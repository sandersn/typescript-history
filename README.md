# typescript-history
A History of TypeScript

## Why?

1. Typescript is by now an important part of the history of programming.
2. The current Typescript team is best placed to collect and generate primary documents.
3. Typescript is open source in everything else; we should be open in making our history available.

## Storage of Primary Documents

This is the public repo for this project.
The old design notes are here for now, but likely should be moved to the microsoft org.
We also need to figure out what else should be available to the public, if anything.

## History

Some ideas for what this project will create:

* People - cast of characters
* Language design - just an overview, or maybe deeper analysis
* Events - times when Typescript interacted with the rest of the world
* Timeline - list of language design ideas and events, ordered by date. Orta already has [a list that covers most of the timeline](https://orta.io/notes/js/why-typescript), especially recent events.
* Interviews

## Next Tasks

- [x] Catalogue people from github and codeplex.
- [x] Create initial timeline.
- [x] generate mermaid timeline from JSON
- [x] Copy Hannah's timeline into JSON
- [x] Convert Onenote to PDF and store in private repo. Also: move this repo to microsoft/
- [ ] Categorise Onenote notes.
- [x] Contact Microsoft legal to ask about making PDF documents public.
- [x] Ask about + conduct a patent review of the notes
- [x] Extract interesting trends and factoids from design notes.
- [ ] Track down missing notes from 2011-2013. (Anders presumably has them in his email.)
- [x] Restore a local copy of the Codeplex archive and upload the source to a new repo named typescript-codeplex or something. Also try to mirror the issues, discussions and wiki in some way.
  - Issues, discussions and wiki are mirrored in codeplex/
  - The mirror of the codeplex git repo is http://github.com/Arnavion/typescript-codeplex (also forked non-readonly to sandersn/typescript-codeplex)
- [ ] Find out how Language Design Constraints wiki page was generated. What discussion happened in 2014? Earlier?

## Done Tasks

1. Catalogue people from Onenote.
