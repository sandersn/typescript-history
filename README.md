# typescript-history
A History of TypeScript

## Why?

1. Typescript is by now an important part of the history of programming.
2. The current Typescript team is best placed to collect and generate primary documents.
3. Typescript is open source in everything else; we should be open in making our history available.

## Storage of Primary Documents

This is the private repo for this project.
Once we figure out permanent storage of documents, it's likely that we'll put them here and move this repo to microsoft.
We also need to figure out what should be available to the public.

## History

Some ideas for what this project will create:

* People - cast of characters
* Language design - just an overview, or maybe deeper analysis
* Events - times when Typescript interacted with the rest of the world
* Timeline - list of language design ideas and events, ordered by date. Orta already has [a list that covers most of the timeline](https://orta.io/notes/js/why-typescript), especially recent events.
* Interviews

## Next Tasks

1. Catalogue people.
2. Create initial timeline.
3. Convert Onenote to PDF and store in private repo. Also: move this repo to microsoft/
4. Categorise Onenote notes.
5. Contact Microsoft legal to ask about making PDF documents public.
6. Extract interesting trends and factoids from design notes.
7. Track down missing notes from 2011-2013. (Anders presumably has them in his email.)
