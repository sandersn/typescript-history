A History of TypeScript

## Storage of Primary Documents

This is the private repo for this project.
Once we figure out permanent storage of documents, it's likely that we'll put them here and move this repo to microsoft.
We also need to figure out what should be available to the public.

* People - cast of characters
* Big ideas - just an overview, or maybe deeper analysis
* Timeline - list of big ideas and events, ordered by date
* Interviews
