    "Description": "As detailed in this StackOverflow question (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13015898/), there does not appear to be a way in TypeScript to do an asynchronous load of a library that has no top-level exports. A common example is a jQuery plugin, which extends the JQuery interface but provides no module functions or variables.\r\n\r\nThe only way I know of to use these libraries right now is to use a /// <reference... comment and load the library some other way (ex. a <script> tag in your HTML). This can become a maintenance headache at large scale.",
