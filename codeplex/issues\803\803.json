      "Message": "Thanks for reporting. Sorry you are hitting issues.\n\nThe problem you outline isn't one we're familiar with.  The only slightly similar error message we've seen is on systems where an older install didn't uninstall properly, and a combination of new & old versions were getting loaded.\n\nBoth types its stating are not compatible are actually in the same DLL - TypeScriptLanguageService.dll, so the only way this seems possible is if it's loading 2 different releases from 2 different locations and trying to call between them.\n\nThe cleanest/safest approach to fix this would be something like:\n - Use Add/Remove programs to remove any copies of TypeScript that appear in the list of installed programs.\n - From within Visual Studio, go to Tools / Extension Manager to see if any other installs of TypeScript are still showing here.  If so, remove them.\n - Search your \"program files\" (\"Program Files (x86)\" if a 64-bit machine) folder for any remaining copies of this DLL (i.e. from within the program files folder, run \"dir /s TypeScriptLanguageService.*\").\n - If any folders remain containing the TypeScript files, make a note of the location and move them elsewhere (or just delete them if feeling brave, but wouldn't hurt to keep a backup).\n - Reinstall TypeScript 0.8.3 (if super cautious, a reboot before this step wouldn't hurt).\n\nHopefully this should resolve the issue for you.  Please reply back and let us know.\n\nThanks!\n\n - Bill\n",
