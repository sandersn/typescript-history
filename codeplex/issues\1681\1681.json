    "Description": "This looks like the same issue as [1564](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/1564), but I'm getting it with develop bits (as of 09/12/2013 at 3pm).\r\n\r\nMinimal repro is attached to this case.\r\n\r\nI did not do very extensive research just yet, but it looks like there being several files is essential for repro: if I put everything into one file, the issue disappears.\r\nThe repro does contain a weird cyclic chain of references, but it's definitely not simple \"A referenced B, and B references A\" case: I tried to simplify the case by removing some interfaces from the hierarchy in m1.d.ts, and it usually made the issue disappear.\r\nAnother note: this does not happen on \"Release-0.9.2\" bits.\r\n\r\nIn short, the attached archive contains the very minimal repro that I've been able to come up with while retaining my sanity.",
