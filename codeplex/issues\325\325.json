    "Description": "I would like to see the compiler remove all of the redundant module declarations.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you have something like this:\r\n// A.ts\r\nmodule Test {\r\n  export class A {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// B.ts\r\nmodule Test {\r\n  export class B {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIt compiles to something like:\r\nvar Test;\r\n(function(Test) {\r\n  var A = (function  () {\r\n  })();\r\n  Test.A = A;\r\n})(Test || Test = {});\r\n\r\nvar Test;\r\n(function(Test) {\r\n  var B = (function  () {\r\n  })();\r\n  Test.B = B;\r\n})(Test || Test = {});\r\n\r\nWhen it could simply be:\r\nvar Test;\r\n(function(Test) {\r\n  var A = (function  () {\r\n  })();\r\n  Test.A = A;\r\n\r\n  var B = (function() {\r\n  })();\r\n  Test.B = B;\r\n})(Test || Test = {});\r\n\r\nwhich is a rather significant size improvement even with this tiny example. On a real project, we could be talking about kilobytes of savings.\r\n\r\nWe can't do this for all of them (since Test.A may depend on Other.B which depends on Test.B, so Test.B needs to come first, then Other.B, then Test.A, so they have to be separate), but it seems like it wouldn't be too crazy that as it compiles them to group all the same modules together in the output.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis has probably been suggested somewhere, but I couldn't find it. If it has, please let me know and I'll point towards that.",
