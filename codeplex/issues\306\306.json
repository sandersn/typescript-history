    "Description": "Hi!\r\n\r\nThe current draft supports the 'import Foo from \"bar\"' syntax which is a lot less verbose than the current TypeScript syntax for loading modules. It can be interpreted as:\r\n\r\nimport {Foo} = module('bar');\r\n\r\nWhich in an AMD module would be:\r\n\r\nrequire(['bar'], function (__bar__) {\r\n  var Foo = __bar__.Foo;\r\n});\r\n\r\nThanks!",
