    "Description": "I tried to convert my open source project jRiappTS to generic collections and DbSets.\r\nIt has collection.ts and db.ts modules. collection.ts defines basic classes. I converted them to generic classes and it worked. After testing that all is compiled successfully ,i further proceded to convert classes in db.ts module (DbSet, DataView, ChildDataView). This try was not successfull because, constructor arguments in these classes also have generic parameters. The compiler (0.9.1.1 version) can not assign derived generic arguments of type Entity (the derived) to CollectionItem (the base). \r\nI attached the solution. You can reproduce the bug, opening the solution, then opening jriapp.ts file in designer (it is the root file which contains all references to the other project files) and try to rebuild the project.\r\nP.S. I attached imge file showing errors in VS2012 and attached zip archive with the solution.\r\nThese errors should not happen, because the types are assignable (it is bug).",
