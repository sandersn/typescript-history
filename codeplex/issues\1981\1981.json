And the SVG errors messages are still there too. However, none of these errors appear when I pull simplified versions out into stand-alone modules.\n\nClearly my TypeScript code has accumulated a lot of issues that I've got away with until now. Looks like it's my problem. But heh, that's what TypeScript is supposed to pick up on :) .",
