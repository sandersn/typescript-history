    "Html": "Currently the reference can be used to impact what the tsc command line utility compiles to javascript. This is done by utilizing a comment.<br />\n<br />\n/// &lt;reference path=&quot;SomeFile.ts&quot; /&gt;<br />\n<br />\nThis is helpful when working with internal typescript modules as the command line utility will then also generate the javascript for SomeFile.ts. To users that do not use the Visual Studio IDE this tag is just a comment. I feel it would empower non Visual Studio IDE users more if there was another way to reference an internal typescript reference other than using a comment. The &quot;import&quot; keyword is nice, but can only be used for external modules. The import keyword could most likely be expanded to work for this internal case, or cases where references are made, but an AMD type loader is not utilized.<br />\n",

I don't think many other programming languages use comments to handle anything important. When I brought up removeComments I thought of your point jamesnw, it is just one of the many examples of why having something important in the comments becomes a hassle. When you don't use Visual Studio it just looks really awkward when it shows up as a common but is trying to accomplish what &quot;using&quot; would.<br />\n",
