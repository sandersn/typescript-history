<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Source Code Branches</h1>TypeScript development happens across multiple branches or forks (inspired by an article on <a href="https://typescript.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=http%3a%2f%2fnvie.com%2fposts%2fa-successful-git-branching-model%2f&referringTitle=source%20code%20branches">effective git branching</a>).  The main three branches are: 
<ul><li><b>&#39;master&#39;</b>  This branch tracks the changesets of the released versions.</li>
<li><b>&#39;develop&#39;</b>  This branch tracks the cutting edge shared among developers and may be unstable.</li>
<li><b>&#39;release-x.x&#39;</b>  Each release branch tracks what is expected to be part of a particular release.  Checkins to a release branch are largely to stabilize the branch in preparation for a release.</li></ul>
Other experimental work is done on separate forks, which can be found through the CodePlex site under &quot;Forks&quot; in the Source Code tab.</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
