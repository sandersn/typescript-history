    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, under certain circumstances, when a TypeScript file is copied from one project to another, the build action also changes to something other than \"TypeScriptCompile\".\r\n\r\nTo reproduce\r\n`\r\n1. Open up the attached solution, which should contain three projects.\r\n2. Drag and drop file \"Script.ts\" from project B to A.\r\n3. Right-click on A/Script.ts, view properties and the build action should correctly display \"TypeScriptCompile\".\r\n4. Drag and drop \"Script.ts\" from B to C.\r\n5. In my case C/Script.ts now has build action \"CodeAnalysisDictionary\".\r\n6. Drag and drop \"Promise.ts\" from C to B.\r\n7. In my case B/Promise.ts has build action \"Fakes\".\r\n\r\n",
