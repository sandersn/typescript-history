    "Description": "TypeScript v0.8.1.0\r\nVS 2012\r\n\r\nWhen building the project, the TSC compiler checks every TS files (.ts, .d.ts) even those not included in the project.\r\nI dont know if this is by design or if it is a bug.\r\n\r\nIf one of the excluded file contains an error, it is sometime difficult to understand why the project build fails because the compiler doesnt provide feedback on where the error is.\r\nBut as the file isnt included in the project it is sometimes difficult to understand why the build failed.\r\n",

My guess would be perhaps that the VS project file includes something like the below, which looks for every .ts file under the project path and passes it to the compiler, rather than passing each (and only) every project file specifically.\n\n<ItemGroup>\n    <TypeScriptCompile Include=\"$(ProjectDir)\\**\\*.ts\" />\n/ItemGroup>",
