We edit similar-sized solutions without much problem, but have found that some code constructs present much more performance problems than others. Can you upload an example project where you're seeing issues (use the \"re-open\" button at the top of this form) ? Thanks!\n\r\n\r** Closed by RyanCavanaugh 08/12/2013 12:49PM",
