    "Html": "I'm using version 0.9.1.1 (latest as of writing). My Visual Studio project was failing to compile one TS file, but wasn't giving any errors either. Compiling it with the command line gave the error &quot;Microsoft JScript runtime error: Unable to get value of the property 'flags': object is null or undefined&quot;. \r<br />\n<br />\nI narrowed down the actual error in the file by trial and error and reduced it to:<br />\n<pre><code>function y(fun: () =&gt; void, val) {\n    return val;\n}\n\nfunction x(val) {\n    var val = y(function () {\n        var e;\n    }, val);\n}</code></pre>\n\nI know it doesn't look great but the unit tests weren't complaining. \r<br />\nThe error goes away if I comment out the var declaration in function <em>x</em>: <br />\n<pre><code>function y(fun: () =&gt; void, val) {\n    return val;\n}\n\nfunction x(val) {\n    var val = y(function () {\n        //var e;\n    }, val);\n}</code></pre>\n\nIs this expected behaviour?<br />\n",

    "Html": "I ran into the exact same compile error though I could never track down the exact line that caused the problem.  I worked around it by replacing the .js files in <code>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\TypeScript</code> with ones downloaded from <a href=\"https://typescript.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#bin/tsc.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://typescript.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#bin/tsc.js</a> in the release-0.9.2 branch.\r<br />\n<br />\nI think the release-0.9-2 branch might be a little more stable than develop.  At least I had false compile errors with develop that I didn't get with release-0.9.2.<br />\n",
