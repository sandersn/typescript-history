    "Description": "This only occurs if you insert a space before the opening curly brace.\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction SampleFcn(): number[] \r\n```\r\n\r\nPaste that into Visual Studio in a new TypeScript file. Now, at the end of the function line, type ` {` (note the space before the curly brace). You'll end up with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction SampleFcn(): number[] {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, without moving the text cursor, hit enter to insert a new line between the braces. You'll end up with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction SampleFcn(): number[]  \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt deletes the braces and inserts a new line!\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that you would end up with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction SampleFcn(): number[] {\r\n  \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this bug is *not* triggered if you have some additional formatting issues, such as extraneous spaces before the `function` definition begins. It also does *not* occur if there is no space between the return value type and the opening brace.\r\n\r\nIf this is the wrong place to file this bug, please let me know.",
