I excluded all my compiled js from the tfs and building and it works fine. It also worked fine with publishing it from Visual Studio.\r<br />\n<br />\nBut we have a build script, which does something like this:\r<br />\nmsbuild &quot;...project.csproj&quot; /maxcpucount /t:rebuild /p:Configuration=release /target:_CopyWebApplication /property:OutDir=...Site_Temp\\\r<br />\n<br />\nWhich seems to compile the typescript files with a line for tsc.exe ...lots of files...\r<br />\nHowever when i have a look in my folder there are no files there, only my non-compiled javascript files. Am i missing something stupid?<br />\n",
