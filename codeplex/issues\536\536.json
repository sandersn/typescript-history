    "Description": "In TS 0.8.1.0 source map debugging did not work in IE9, but it did in IE10 Win7 Preview. But, once you refreshed the page, the debugging would no longer work.\n\nWith the release of 0.8.1.1 source map debugging now works in IE9, but the same issue exists where if you refresh the page, the debugging no longer works.\n\nI attached a screen shot of my break point, which execution stopped at the first time, but did not stop at after I refreshed the page. As you can see from the screen shot it looks like symbols or whatever are loaded, but VS is not stopping when execution hits that break point.",
