I expected it to be useful for building up a type hierarchy for an interface/class but it doesn't seem to be for that purpose.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm playing with it on the 'develop' branch and I'm seeing some weird results.  If I call it on a class name which is extended by other classes, I get back positions that seem to correspond to the other classes (though the behavior seems somewhat inconsistent based on where the class name occurs).  Also, all of the ReferenceEntries are duplicated (I get each result twice).  Calling this method on an interface doesn't seem to do anything.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny hints as to what this is for?<br />\n",
