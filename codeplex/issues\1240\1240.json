    "Description": "The compile on save(http://typescript.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Compile-on-Save) feature is broken in v0.9 for project with a large number of files and/or long file paths.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 errors are displayed in the error list and then visual studio becomes unusable:\r\n\r\n1. Could not find the file: \"<filepath>.ts\"\r\n2. The command \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\TypeScript\\tsc.exe\" \"<allTSFiles>\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFor now we have to use Web Essentials to compile on save but this takes 15-20 per save.\r\n\r\nLooks like the command line limit is being reached as shorting the paths or removing files fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
