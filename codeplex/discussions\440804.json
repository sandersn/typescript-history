    "Html": "Newbee question: Is there someway to setup breakpoints and step through the code using page inspector? \r<br />\n<br />\nI expected this to work: Create a new TypeScript project, add a single alert statement to the source file, set a breakpoint on an alert statement, launch with pageInspector, hit the break point. (I'm running VS 11 with the latest TypeScript build. I didn't do anything special to &quot;install&quot; page inspector. The option to launch with it was just there.)\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat I actually see is the alert fire but the break point is not hit. Instead I get a warning saying: &quot;Page Inspector Prerequisits. Server Code Mapping Requirements. No mapping data was returned from the server. Debugging must be enabled in the Web.config file, or the application setting &quot;PageInspector:ServerCodeMappingSupport&quot; must be set to &quot;Enabled&quot;. Development server must be running on .NET 4.0 or later. Page Inspector's Runtime must be installed in the Global Assembly Cache. Page Inspector's Runtime must be registered in root web.config.&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nPhew. Would someone be so kind as the hold my hand and walk me through ensure all that is configured? I'm guessing I wouldn't be the only person with this problem. I'm running a vanilla setup.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nChris<br />\n",
