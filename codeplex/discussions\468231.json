I have a grunt + typescript build process that listens for file changes. \r<br />\n<br />\nThe problem is that visual studio keeps adding  an msbuild task to my project when i add a typescript file, or update typings via nuget.\r<br />\n<br />\nIdeally if i could add an msbuild condition to cancel the typescript msbuild take that would stop this compilation. <br />\n",
