    "Html": "Hi there,\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm wondering how I can recompile in real-time with tsc. I see that the Playground and Visual Studio do type checking all the time. The playground even goes so far to re-generate the JavaScript output every time I change my code. How do I have to start tsc to accomplish this behavior? I'd like to get diagnostics without starting tsc all the time (even if I would, it's too slow to get the same behavior as the Playground or VS).<br />\n",
