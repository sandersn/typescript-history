    "Description": "We are building a TypeScript plug-in for Eclipse and have noticed that with both 0.9.1 and the latest develop branch we are getting duplicate errors when calling getSemanticDiagnostics() multiple times.  Each time we call the API it seems to create another copy of the error.  So if the API is called 4 times, we'll end up getting an error back 4 times.  \r\n\r\nBetween the calls there are typically edits to at least one file which is not one the files with errors.  We call getSemanticDiagnostics() for every file whenever any file is saved to ensure we pick up breaks or fixes across files.",
