    "Description": "After \"successfully installing\" TypeScript 0.9.1.1, it doesn't show up in Tools, Extensions. Add > New Item doesn't show the file type TypeScript. When I attempt to create a .ts file, VS converts it to a .cs file, further validating that TypeScript for VS is not properly installed.\r\n\r\nThis is on a Windows 7 machine with Visual Studio Professional 2012, 2010, 2008 installed.\r\n\r\nI've uninstalled and installed TypeScript to no avail.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
