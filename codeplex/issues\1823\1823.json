    "Description": "The JS code generated for TypeScript classes looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMyClass.prototype.mySomething = \"asd qwe\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes the properties in the prototype enumerable and they show up if you loop over the properties of the instances of MyClass. This is not how builtin JS classes behave and generally is not what one intends especially when defining methods for a class.\r\n\r\nShould be something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nObject.defineProperty( MyClass.prototype, \"mySomething\", { value: \"asd qwe\" } );\r\n```",
