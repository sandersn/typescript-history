It appears to be the args?: string[] which is causing the issue - without it, it works fine.",

      "Message": "Thanks.  This looks pretty bad.  It seems to be a confluence of 3 factors: It needs to be a constructor, with a parameter specified with a type literal, and that type contains an array member.  Without any of those 3 it doesn't repro.  (i.e. Use a named interface for the 'args' type and it goes away).  The minimal repro I can come with for this is below.\n\n```typescript\nclass C1 {\n     constructor(options: { member: string[]; }){\n\t }\n}\n\nvar b = new C1({member: []});\n```\n\nWe'll take a look into this.",
