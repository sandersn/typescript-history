    "ClosedComment": "This is by design. We allow you to redeclare a variable in a non-global scope as long as the type is exactly the same at both declarations. This is just a convenience feature for things like if/else blocks where people commonly redeclare a variable of the same name and type in each branch due to familiarity with languages with block scoping that JavaScript doesn't do.",
