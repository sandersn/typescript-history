I know that tsc.exe esists in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\TypeScript\\0.9 but we cannot rely on this value since the version might change later. I search environment variables and registry and I did not find some thing suitable.\r<br />\n<br />\nVS version: 2013\r<br />\nI installed TypeScript using TypeScriptSetup.1.0rc\r<br />\n<br />\nAny help would be appreciated,\r<br />\nThanks<br />\n",
