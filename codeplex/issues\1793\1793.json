    "Description": "It seems I can type in a wide variety of gibberish into the class D below without the compiler complaining:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass A<a> {\r\n   f (t: C): void {}\r\n   g (t: D): void {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass B {\r\n   h (a: A<any>): void {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass C extends B {\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Should be errors at the three points marked below.\r\nclass D {\r\n   e: E; // E not defined\r\n\r\n   constructor (e: E) { // E not defined\r\n      super() // no super-constructor\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimplifying much from here (e.g. deleting the \"extends\" clause, or removing a type parameter) exposes the errors. But otherwise, I can type a lot of syntactically well-formed but semantically meaningless stuff into the body of D, and it will compile.",
