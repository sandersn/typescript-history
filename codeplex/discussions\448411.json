There was a bug report here which was closed:  <a href=\"https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/1213\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/1213</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nI uninstalled web essentials and resinstalled TS 0.9.0 and even compiled from the command line.  The sourcemap is generated for a very simple standalone file.  The breakpoints won't load in VS.\r<br />\n<br />\nAre you able to debug .ts files with 0.9.0?\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThanks much,\r<br />\nJon<br />\n",
