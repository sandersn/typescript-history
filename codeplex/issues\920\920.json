I think it would be a little more clear if it said something about 3 not being a string.\r\n\r\n(I made this mistake myself when trying to pass something I had delcared as a \"String\" instead of a \"string\" and was confused.)",

      "Message": "Thanks for reporting.  In the 0.9.0 branch, this error goes away completely, due to changes we have made with index signatures.  Specifically, section 3.7.4 now states: \n\nâ€¢\tString index signatures, specified using index type string, define type constraints for all properties and numeric index signatures in the containing type. Specifically, in a type with a string index signature of type T, all properties and numeric index signatures must have types that are subtypes of T.\n\nThe latest language spec should be in the GIT repository, and the 0.9.0 compiler under development can be used from there also.",
