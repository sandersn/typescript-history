    "Description": "Having installed typescript plugin I am able to create files in VS2012 but not in VS2013. There are no menu items in VS2013 related to typescript. But I'm able to manualy create ts files and thay are compiles into js perfectly.\r\nThere are no any errors during plugin installation. \r\nTools->Options->TypeScript is present in VS2013.\r\nSo it seems a bug.",
