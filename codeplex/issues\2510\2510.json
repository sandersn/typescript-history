    "Description": "Dear TypeScript Team,\r\n\r\nThe following code used to work - I believe as recently as TS 1.0 - but now fails. I'm using the latest Knockout.js with DefinitelyTyped declarations; however, the error occurred after I upgraded to VS 2013 Update 2 (I skipped the RC, although I kept TypeScript updated), and seems to have nothing to do with the 3rd-party library.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tprivate _quantity = ko.observable(0); // This is still correctly inferred as KnockoutObservable<number>.\r\n\tpublic quantity = ko.computed({ // ERROR: This is now incorrectly inferred as KnockoutComputed<any>.\r\n\t\tread: () => this._quantity(), // REGRESSION: This used to infer the type of 'read' as () => number, but now has only () => any.\r\n\t\twrite: value => this._quantity(value),\r\n\t\towner: this\r\n\t});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I don't know exactly which version(s) are affected; I may have skipped a minor version or two during the VS2013 Update 2 RC phase.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nLars",
