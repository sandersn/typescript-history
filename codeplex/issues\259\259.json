    "Description": "Since TypeScript is aligned toward the new ECMAScript proposals, it'd be nice if it supported the proposed heredoc-style strings. Which are multiline strings using the ` character. Example:\r\n\r\nvar message:string = `this\r\n  would\r\n     all\r\n      be in the\r\n        same string`;\r\n\r\n// => \"this\\n  would\\n     all\\n      be in the\\n        same string\"\r\n\r\n#suggestion",
