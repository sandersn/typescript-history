In an JS example I do the following:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>(<span style=\"color:blue\">function</span>() {\r\n    load();\r\n\r\n    <span style=\"color:blue\">function</span> load() {\r\n        requirejs([], boot);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    <span style=\"color:blue\">function</span> boot() {\r\n        require([<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'bootstrapper'</span>], <span style=\"color:blue\">function</span>(bs) { bs.run(); });\r\n    }\r\n})();\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>But obviously this does not work, because &quot;requirejs&quot; and &quot;require&quot; is not know. Can anyone help me with my starting problems?</p>\r\n",
