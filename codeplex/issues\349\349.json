    "Description": "Originally I had several files with references between them, but was able to boil it down to two files and a declaration file, which, for ease of use, I combined into one file with comments to separate the files. The error occurs in visual studio, the playground and when running tsc. Although, in the playground no error is shown, but intellisense is broken. \r\n\r\nThe first file doesn't use anything from the second file (and vice versa). Originally the second file did reference code in the first file, but that code was removed since it didn't have any affect on reproducing the bug.\r\n\r\nThe code will compile and intellisense will work again if any of the following are done:\r\n- change 'String' to 'string' (String is defined in lib.d.ts)\r\n- declare 'contents' inside the for loop instead of before\r\n- remove 'arg' parameter from foobar function\r\n- change list.forEach to a for loop\r\n\r\nCode is also added as an attachment since it doesn't show up formatted.\r\n\r\n// excerpt from node.d.ts\r\ndeclare module \"fs\"\r\n{\r\n    export function readFileSync(filename: string, encoding: string): String;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// begin first file\r\nimport fs = module(\"fs\");\r\nfunction func(filePaths)\r\n{\r\n\tvar contents;\r\n\tfor (var i = 0; i < filePaths.length; i++)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tcontents = fs.readFileSync(filePaths[i], \"utf8\");\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n// begin second file\r\nclass Class1\r\n{\r\n\tfoo()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tvar list = [];\r\n\t\tlist.forEach((item) =>\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tthis.bar(\"asdf\");\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tbar(val)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tvar foobar;\r\n\t\tif (val)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tfoobar = function (arg) { };\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\telse\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tfoobar = function (arg) { };\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n",
