    "Description": "I accidentally tried to overload a method as follows - note the incorrect use of uppercase \"String\".\r\n\r\npublic static getKeyCode(value: String): number;\r\n\r\nEverything was building fine until I tried to \r\ncall the method, e.g. StringUtility.getKeyCode(\"a\"); Suddenly the compiler would fail with exit code 1, but with no useful error message at all. After quite awhile, I finally realized my mistake:\r\n\r\npublic static getKeyCode(value: string): number;\r\n\r\nNow everything compiles and runs fine, but I found that to be a tricky bug to track down, especially since String is a valid type. I would've at least expected an error message complaining about me using the wrong type.",
