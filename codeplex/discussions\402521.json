It is available in many languages and now TypeScript is one of those.</p>\r\n<p>It was created using the public preview TypeScript version. It includes Unit Tests made in TypeScript and run on the generated JavaScript with YUITest (included minimal YUITest descriptions file).</p>\r\n<p>I had to use an Ant task of my own to recursively read TypeScript files in tests and sources directories and to fix a problem I had working on the same module from multiple TypeScript files (more explanations on my blog post).</p>\r\n<p>If you are specifically interested in PureMVC, the result of my work will probably soon be published on the official PureMVC&nbsp;website.</p>\r\n<p>As a result of this, I expect to report near 5 or 6 issues and some current issues votes. ;)</p>\r\n",
