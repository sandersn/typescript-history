    "Description": "I downloaded and installed TypeScript 0.8.2 from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34790 to be used within VS2012 Ultimate edition running in a Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise (2 Intel Xeon @ 2.13GHz, 8 GB)\r\n\r\nAfter adding a TypeScript file to it, when I reopen the solution VS 2012 displays the messages \"(initializing)\" and hangs\r\n\r\nI know now that my Operating System is not listed as supported but I'm wonder if that has something to do (or not) with the issue I'm experiencing.\r\n\r\nAny help on this is very appreciated",
