For Node JS applications you will have to look at creating a private NPM or some mechanism for copying the library into the node_modules folder.<br />\n<br />\nSee also:<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Work Items</strong><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/571\" rel=\"nofollow\">TypeScript Library project type in Visual Studio</a> <br />\n<a href=\"https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/2171\" rel=\"nofollow\">Please provide a &quot;TypeScript Class Library&quot; project template</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Discussions</strong><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/507413\" rel=\"nofollow\">We're searching a good workflow for our typescript project.
