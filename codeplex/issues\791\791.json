      "Message": "I'm a bit confused, because some snippets seem to currently work (I'm using VS2013 with TS1.0RC) but not all. Actually, almost all the default ones work, except the one I really care about (cl -> console.log). I'm not sure where these are loaded from though. Changing the Javascript ones don't seem to impact the Typescript ones, and I can't find where these I'm currently using are stored...",
