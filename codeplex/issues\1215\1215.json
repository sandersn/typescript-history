For the following file content:\n\n>BOF\nclass A\n   {\n}\n\n   var a    = 71;\n\n var    b   = 371;\n>EOF\n\nselecting the 2 var lines works with Format Selection.\nselecting the class does not work with Format selection.\nselecting all with Format selection does no work as Format Document fails.",
