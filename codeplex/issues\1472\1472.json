    "Description": "While upgrading my languageService client to 0.9.x, I kept running into exceptions when trying to use `getSemanticDiagnostics`. The exception was about trying to select `isResolved` from `null`. Debugging shows the culprit to be in method `cachedRegExpInterfaceType`, file `src/compiler/typecheck/pullTypeResolution.ts` (line 230, develop branch).\r\n\r\nThe second conditional does not guard against `this._cachedRegExpInterfaceType` still being `null`, even after the first conditional tried to fill it.",
