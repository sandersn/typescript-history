      "Message": "This is due to the line-ending on your map.ts file, which is using 0x0D only endings.  According to Wikipedia, these lines ending are created by the following systems: \n - Commodore 8-bit machines, Acorn BBC, TRS-80, Apple II family, Mac OS up to version 9 and OS-9.\nI can reproduce this issue by using Sublime Text and saving with \"Mac OS 9\" line-endings.  If I use Windows or Unix/OS X line-endings I get no error.\n\nWe have a work-item to fix this, but in the meantime using a different line-ending (e.g. your rect.ts file has Windows line-endings) should resolve the issue.",
