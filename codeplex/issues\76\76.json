    "Description": "This will be very useful for automating the compiler from an asset management / bundling code without having to write to intermediate files.\r\n\r\nSo, if the compiler can output to console, any process that calls the compiler can then redirect the standard output stream when calling the compiler and use the generated JS directly without looking up files.\r\n\r\nsomething like:\r\n\r\ntsc source.ts --outconsole\r\nI think you can come up with a better name for the flag though!",
