    "Description": "I am making an msbuild task that drives tsc and I am capturing the output and attempting to provide accurate file, line, column and message information to msbuild. However as I am trying to do this I am seeing that error message formats can come in multiple forms. The trick is that if I have to parse these error messages the actual message body should probably come last, since it can contain any character, whereas the file can only have certain characters and the ( , ) surrounding and splitting the line/col are easy to parse.\r\n\r\nI am seeing:\r\n[message] [file] ([line], [col]) : [message2]\r\n[file] ([line], [col]) [message]\r\n[message]\r\n\r\nAnd possibly more.\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n- create a simple class in a file somewhere\r\n- temporarily delete lib.d.ts from your path (should probably copy it somewhere first)\r\n- > tsc.exe simpleClass.ts\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nerrors to occur, all with this format: [file] ([col], [line]) [message]\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nmixed error message formats.",
