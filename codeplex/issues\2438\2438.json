    "Description": "The suggestion is to allow generic parameter overloads like the following:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ndeclare module Backbone {\r\n    class Model{}\r\n    class Events{}\r\n    class ViewOptions<TModel extends Model> {}\r\n    class Collection<TModel extends Model> {}\r\n\r\n    // Generic parameter overload\r\n    class View extends View<Backbone.Model>;\r\n    class View<TModel extends Model> extends Events { // Don't take as duplicate identifier\r\n        constructor(options?: ViewOptions<TModel>);\r\n        model: TModel;\r\n        collection: Collection<TModel>;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// With Generics Parameter overloads, old non-generic consumer\r\n// code works as before and does not need to change.\r\nclass MyView extends Backbone.View {\r\n}\r\nvar myView = new MyView();\r\nvar model = myView.model; // model is of type Backbone.Model\r\n\r\n// Can gradually introduce generic parameters to Views\r\nclass DerivedModel extends Backbone.Model {\t\r\n}\r\nvar myView2 = new Backbone.View<DerivedModel>();\r\nvar model2 = myView2.model; // model2 is of type DerivedModel\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is important because this would allow people to introduce generics in their library declarations without breaking large amounts of existing code for the consumers. We do this a lot in C#, and it is compatible with TypeScript design because it won't make any changes in the resulting javascript, and works pretty much like method overloads in TypeScript.\r\n\r\nRelated discussion: https://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/452741\r\n",
