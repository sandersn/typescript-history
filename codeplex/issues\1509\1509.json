    "Description": "The MSBuild VsTsc task for compiling TypeScript has an OutFile attribute, but setting this attribute does not cause it to pass an --out parameter to tsc.exe. I would like to override the standard generated output filename, but I can currently only accomplish this by using the Exec task to run tsc.exe.\r\n\r\nFrom looking at the VsTsc task source code with Reflector, it doesn't look as if the OutFile attribute is used for anything but setting the GeneratedJavascript. This seems like a bug.",
