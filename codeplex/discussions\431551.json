And maybe that's what typescript needs, macro support. \r<br />\n<br />\nThe web community has shown many times over that they can create some compelling solutions to problems, jquery plugins are a good example, or the many many cool js libraries we have today. \r<br />\n<br />\nMacro support in typescript would open the door to that and could hugely improve adoption. <br />\n",

I don't know if it would work, but I agree that it's a shame that we're missing out on a whole bunch of useful language features just because the ECMA6 committee can't be brought to their senses.<br />\n<br />\nPerhaps the release (and eventual implementation) of ECMA6 will actually free up TS to be a real alternative. If folks want strict adherence to ECMA6, well, they can write their code in ECMA6. If folks want a modern language, they can write their code in TS. That is, if TS will accept its destiny.<br />\n",
