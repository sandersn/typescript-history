    "Description": "TypeScript makes it possible to extend interfaces accidentally since the following will either add a name property to an existing interface or will create a new interface:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\ninterface MyInterface {\r\n\r\n\tname : string;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWould it be preferable to separate defining and extending interfaces like this:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\ninterface MyInterface { // If MyInterface already exists, this will cause a compile error\r\n\r\n\tname : string;\r\n\r\n} \r\n\r\ninterface MyInterface extends MyInterface { // If MyInterface doesn't exist, this will cause a compile error\r\n\r\n\tname : string;\r\n\r\n}",
