    "Description": "Curious if building in type safety around the use of || is something you guys might be interested in. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction foo(s: string): string {\r\n  return s || 5;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat compiles, even though foo doesn't always return a string.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction foo(s: string) {\r\n  var lower = (s || 5).toLowerCase();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilar problem there as well. I played around with && and it seems to work ok:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction foo(obj: { name: string }) {\r\n  var x = 5;\r\n  x = obj && obj.name;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat does not compile, as expected.",
