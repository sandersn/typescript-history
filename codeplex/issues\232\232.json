    "Description": "Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1> Create typescript project in VS2012.\r\n2> Create two .TS files with classes in each.\r\n3> Close both files.\r\n4> Double-click on each file in the solution explorer very quickly.  Be sure to open the second file BEFORE the Intellisense cache of method names appears in the navigation drop down list at the top of the code editor window (while it still says \"Refreshing...\").\r\n\r\nResult: \r\nIf the second file is opened before the Intellisense cache is loaded on the first, then neither will have Intellisense at all.",
