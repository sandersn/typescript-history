    "Description": "This is a VS issue, not a TS problem:\r\nIf you right-click on a member variable in a .ts file, you can select Refactor->Rename to rename all instances of the selected variable. However, this does not work for member variables which have been defined in the class's constructor:\r\n\r\nclass MyClass( public name: string ) { ... }\r\n\r\nRefactoring the variable string does only rename this instance but not any other instances. Tested in VS 2012 Express for the Web with the TS plug-in.",
