    "Description": "It looks like it's not possible to specify multiple base_path's for relative lookup of import modules and references. This means we have to put all our files into one folder or have crazy relative lookup paths like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/// <reference path=\"../../../../refs/jquery/jquery.d.ts\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile it could be nice to add something that includes multiple search paths. \r\n\r\nI noticed there is a push for cleaner reference syntax, adding this would make it more usable like the way Flash had it with it's classpath and import syntax. This will make it easier to organize projects and let us keep the type declarations in separate folder (like when using the tsd command line tool).\r\n\r\n",

I'm not clear (yet) on why TypeScript uses relative paths, but if I put my declaration in the base_path then doing this won't work:\n\n```\n/// <reference path=\"/jquery.d.ts\" />\n```\n\nMaybe supporting both would be good, if there's a clear syntax.",
