That plugin extends Backbone.View and adds a method called stickit() to the View class.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe definitions for Backbone.View from DF is:<br />\n<pre><code>declare module Backbone {\n{\n    class View extends Events implements OptionalEvents {\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\nThe usage of the stickit plugin is:<br />\n<pre><code>var myView:Backbone.View = new Backbone.View();\nmyView.stickit();</code></pre>\n\nIs there any way I can make this happen? Since View is a class I cannot re-declare it. Any pointers would be much appreciated!<br />\n",

    "Html": "In TypeScript, while modules and interfaces are open-ended, classes are not.  This means you won't be able to re-declare existing classes with new members.\r<br />\n<br />\nThat said, since you're using a declare module, the classes inside them are also declare classes.  You can write declare classes as interfaces:<br />\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">declare</span> <span style=\"color:Blue;\">module</span> Backbone {\n    <span style=\"color:Blue;\">interface</span> View <span style=\"color:Blue;\">extends</span> Events, OptionalEvents { }\n}\r\n</pre></div>This would mean going and fixing up the previous declares to also use interfaces, but once you did you would have an open-ended View declaration.<br />\n",
