    "Description": "Since you don't allow code contributions via pull requests or the like **yet**, here is a contribution to `winjs.d.ts`:\r\n```\r\nexport class Promise {\r\n    \tconstructor(init: (c: any, e: any, p: any) => void);\r\n        public then: any;\r\n        static join: any;\r\n        static timeout: any;\r\n        static as: any; // Added\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nexport module UI {\r\n        export var Animation: any; // Added\r\n        export var process: any;\r\n        export var processAll: any;\r\n        export var ListLayout: any;\r\n        export var GridLayout: any;\r\n        export var Pages: any;\r\n        export var Menu: any;\r\n        export var setOptions: any;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote that I have only completed them for being able to run the simple *Navigation* template for Windows 8 apps.\r\n\r\n*BTW*, the indent styles should be standardized in the declaration file! There are tabs as well as spaces!",
