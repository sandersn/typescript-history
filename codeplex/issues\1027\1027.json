In the meantime, hope for a world where forward slashes are treated as co-equals with their backslash counterparts.",

    "Description": "At the very top:\r\n\r\n```\r\n///<reference path='..\\..\\harness\\external\\json2stringify.ts' />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe actual file name in that directory is json2Stringify.ts (uppercase S).\r\n\r\nEither change the filename, or change the reference in there. Compiling like that yields error: 'tsc typescriptServices.ts'.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso you quite often use backslashes for directory delimiters. Given that this all is about webby stuff, it would be more consistent to stick with forward slashes.\r\n\r\nSame old theme as with bool/boolean or XMLDoc/JSDoc -- you guys naturally opt for things familiar in Microsoft ecosystem, but in this project you need to watch that comfort zone decision making. The worst thing that could happen to TypeScript is if the web developer dismiss it as a Microsoft niche language.",
