    "Html": "The TypeScript node.js compiler (<code>tsc -h</code>) no longer provides a <code>--watch</code> switch when running in Windows (Windows 8 in my case). In the TypeScript source code, in io.ts, I can see that there are two implementations of <code>IIO</code>, the second of which provides the node.js FileSystem implementation and the first of which provides a file system option provided by windows script host. When that matches, the watchFile implementation is null, so it doesn't show up in the list of compiler options.<br />\n<br />\nThe node.js fs implementation works fine, so why are we trying to use <code>ActiveXObject(&quot;Scripting.FileSystemObject&quot;)</code>, and why must this come with the price of eliminating the watchFile method?<br />\n<br />\nThe watch switch is more than just useful, it's incredibly annoying not having access to it after having relied on it for half of the project I've been working on so far. Why is it gone and how can I get it back?<br />\n",
