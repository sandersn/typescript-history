    "Description": "When intellisense shows a function with \"someVar: typeof {sometype}\" as a parameter, it expands all properties of the type \"sometype\" into the popup instead of the type name, which is not appropriate.  It is expect that only the specified type name is shown, otherwise the signature displayed is highly confusing.",
