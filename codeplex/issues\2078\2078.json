    "Description": "The [typescript npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/typescript) is great for command line use, but what's missing is library usage. I propose exporting a TypeScript compile method for this case. This [typescript-compiler npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/typescript-compiler) seeks to do just that by modifying the tsc.js file directly and exporting a module, but it would be way better if this was a feature of the TypeScript npm package itself.",
