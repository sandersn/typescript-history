    "Description": "In the following example, 'this' loses the expected meaning once the instance method has been captured:\r\n\r\nclass Greeter {\r\n                greeting: string;\r\n                constructor (message: string) {\r\n                                this.greeting = message;\r\n                }\r\n                greet() {\r\n                                return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\r\n                }\r\n}   \r\n \r\nvar greeter = new Greeter(\"world\");\r\nvar greetFunc = greeter.greet;\r\n \r\n// Note that greetFunc() != greeter.greet()\r\nalert(greetFunc());\r\n \r\nThis code alerts “Hello, undefined”, since in the output JavaScript, we see this definition:\r\n",

      "Message": "That's right - this is by design JavaScript semantics, and TypeScript can't change the meaning of this.  As in JavaScript, you would need to use 'greeter.greet.bind(greeter)' or similar.",
