    "Description": "Errors and warnings (are there warnings?) are reported in the wrong format.\r\nThey are reported in for example the following format:\r\n\r\nC:/Users/serge/Documents/My Web Sites/NodeStarterSite/Raytracer.ts (6,27): Expected ';'\r\n\r\nI have a few issues with this:\r\n\r\n1. I can't determine if this line is an error, warning or just an informational message\r\n2. The error format is not in the MSBuild error format (described in http://blogs.msdn.com/b/msbuild/archive/2006/11/03/msbuild-visual-studio-aware-error-messages-and-message-formats.aspx)\r\n3. Why is there a space between filename and (line,column), in above example: Raytracer.ts (6,27): \r\n\r\nAll my output parsing code looking for MSBuild format messages or even just the word error or warning does not work anymore!",
