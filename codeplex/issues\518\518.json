    "ClosedComment": "TypeScript actually has two sorts of \"errors\" - parse errors (e.g. you try to write something like \"var x = 13%%231f1~;\" and type errors (like the one you got). Code with type errors will still generate JS.\n\nThis is sort of the second level of \"optional\"-ness of the typing system.",

    "Description": "I don't know if the TypeScript compiler is more of a soft-enforcer (since everything goes to Javascript).  When I compile a .ts file via the command line, I keep getting an error, but the Javascript file still gets generated.\r\n\r\nI would assume that the .js file shouldn't be created if the compiler finds an error.  The error is a simple type-mismatch for a function argument.  I also tried putting the code into typescriptlang.com/playground just to be sure and that gave me the error as well.  \r\n\r\nSo I definitely have an error.  The question is whether or not the compilation of TypeScript should still happen if there is a compile error?",
