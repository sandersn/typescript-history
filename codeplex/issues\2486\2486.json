    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nOne helpful option for the VS plugin would be for it to highlight variables of type \"any\" in your code. This could be turned on to provide a visual hint to provide type information.\r\n\r\nEspecially helpful would be if it was due to \"any\" being inferred rather than specified explicitly.\r\n\r\nI think this would be a valuable aid in the TypeScript arsenal; I love TypeScript's static typing and consider variables of type \"any\" to be a slight code smell now.",
