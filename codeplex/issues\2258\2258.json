    "ClosedComment": "The TypeScript tools in VS only invoke the compiler when actually compiling the project. It sounds like there is an extension interfering with your experience, do you have any installed? Like Web Express, Resharper, etc.\n\nThe easier to find this is in Help, About, and than use the \"Copy Info\" button.\n\nClosing for tracking, if you have more info, please re-open.\n",

    "Description": "From: https://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/535688\r\n\r\nI'm also experiencing freezes on VS 2013. Two places I'm certain freezes happen every time are:\r\n\r\n1. When renaming a TS file, VS will freeze for 5 seconds\r\n2. Copy/Paste a file in the same project, VS will freeze when I paste the file\r\n\r\nOther than that, I also experience random freezes when saving a files, sometimes takes 2-3 seconds without being able to move the cursor. This happens exclusively with TS files. I have more C# files than TS files in my project, and they don't cause these issues.\r\n\r\nThese freezes are not new to TS 1.0 RC, I remember having these since started using TS, but have seem less of them lately.\r\n\r\nOn 0.9.5, sometimes I had freezes I had to force close VS 2013. Looking at Procmon when that happened looked like an infinite loop of some kind, as I could see the same calls to TSC being made again and again with 100% cpu usage. Didn't get this kind of freeze with 1.0 RC yet, but I have been using it only for a couple of days.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
