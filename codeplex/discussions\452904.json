When creating a lot of new files in the early stages of a new project, this is very annoying.\r<br />\n<br />\nTo reproduce:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Right click on a folder in the solution panel</li>\n<li>Click Add -&gt; Code File</li>\n<li>Enter a .ts filename, e.g. test.ts</li>\n<li>New, blank file opens as expected</li>\n<li>Visual studio then tells me the file has changed and prompts to reload it</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "Html": "Strange.. I right-click a folder, pick &quot;Add -&gt; TypeScript File&quot;, enter a name and it creates it automatically with no pop-up.\r<br />\n<br />\nIt does fill it with the standard default TS Shape code, but at least it gives you focus so you can just select-all and nuke it. I would rather it didn't create this though. Also quite annoying is that if your project is set to compile to an outfile VS will still link your TS files to JS files, it populates them with the compiled Shape sample code but of course they never change from that point on as when you compile with an outfile the local JS files don't get modified. I wish it could be told not to do either of these things.<br />\n",
