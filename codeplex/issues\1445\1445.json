      "Message": "This may be caused by the change in style of linking to the source map.  The current source map spec now uses \"//#\" at the bottom of JS files instead of \"//@\".  I'm not sure if Chrome supports the new spec, yet, but they will need to be updated.  \n\nYou can try out to see if that's the issue by manually changing the source link at the bottom of the .js file to point the old //@ style.",
