    "Description": "I'm creating a TypeScript version of my streamline.js tutorial. Things were going rather smoothly but I'm now reaching a point where I get a stack overflow when I convert more require statements to import (to get stricter type checking).\r\n\r\nThere is probably something wrong in one of my source or definition files but the compiler should give me an error, not a stack overflow.\r\n\r\nThe code is in the attached zip. I get a stack overflow when I run:\r\n\r\ntsc tuto8-all.ts\r\n\r\nFor a bit of context about what I'm doing, see https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs/tree/typescript\r\n(search the TypeScript section in the page).\r\n\r\nBruno",
