    "Description": "An easy optimization TypeScript could make is to join static strings together at compile time, rather than leaving this operation to the runtime.\r\n\r\nCommon Example:\r\nvar myDiv = \r\n\"<div>\" +\r\n\"<p>\" +\r\n\"Hello world\" +\r\n\"</p>\" +\r\n\"</div>\";\r\n\r\nShould be compile down to:\r\n\"<div><p>Hello world</p></div>\"",

That said, code like this is most common when breaking a large string across lines, and once TypeScript supports \"string interpolation\"/\"template strings\" ([item #19](http://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/19)), this scenario will be accomplished more directly.
