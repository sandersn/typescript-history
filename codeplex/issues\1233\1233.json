    "Description": "The pre-declared `Console` object contains a property `msIsIndependentlyComposed`. It is declared as \r\n\r\n```\r\n    msIsIndependentlyComposed(element: Element): bool;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this should be\r\n\r\n```\r\n    msIsIndependentlyComposed?(element: Element): bool;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, it is clear (and checked) that this property is non-standard, and might not exist. The same should go for all vendor prefixed properties, since they by definition only exist in one browser.",
