    "Description": "If you use Attach to Process/Debug and access to a running Internet Explorer instance, you cannot debug the TypeScript Code. Setting a breakpoint in the .ts says \"No symbols have been loaded. ....\".\nSetting the breakpoint in the corresponding .ts file works like a charm. Starting the Debugger with F5 does also work.\n\nThe same thing happens if you use the debugger keyword and choose VS as the Debugger.\n\nI use\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Professional 2012\nVersion 11.0.50727.1 RTMREL\nand TypeScript 0.8.1\n\nRegards,\nSamuel\n",
