      "Message": "This is currently by design.  The `classList` property is on the `HTMLElement` interface, as implemented in current FF and IE.  For example, these There is inconsistency still here, with some of the newer DOM specs moving this property to ``Element`.  The DOM typing we include in lib.d.ts is autogenerated from standards IDL, so we will typically wait for browser consistency to lead to changes in the IDL we base the typings off of before making spot changes like this.   You are of course free to use a customized version of lib.d.ts for your own applications.",
