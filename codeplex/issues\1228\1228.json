Just bad timing I guess. Also, you need to do a git mv, not a delete and then add - your pull request would have broken the file history.",

      "Message": "All the latest commits are on the develop branch. Also git mv is a macro for add/remove anyway. \n\nI wonder actually, whether we in the community should help Microsoft setting up a Linux build somewhere in Travis or whatever. Just in case Ryan Cavanaugh or Anders Hejlsberg need that extra help figuring out whom to fire in the next round of head cuts.",
