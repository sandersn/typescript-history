    "Description": "If you have some code using a global like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeclare var bar\r\nmodule foo {\r\n\tvar x = bar;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis generates the following code, with `bar` being used directly. \r\n```\r\nvar foo;\r\n(function (foo) {\r\n    var x = bar;\r\n})(foo || (foo = {}));\r\n```\r\nNow if (somewhere far away, but in the same project) you define the following:\r\n```\r\nmodule foo.bar\r\n{\r\n\tclass Foo {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nDefining this changes the generated code for the *first* snippet to:\r\n```\r\nvar foo;\r\n(function (foo) {\r\n    var x = foo.bar;\r\n})(foo || (foo = {}));\r\n```\r\nNotice that it's now generating `foo.bar` for the access to `bar`. \r\n\r\nI understand why this is happening: the second snippet is extending the `foo` namespace with a `bar` namespace, which shadows the global `bar` variable. But I think this is a bad idea: it makes for very brittle code, where changes in one place can break completely unrelated code.\r\n\r\nIn general globals should of course mostly be avoided, but think of the `document` global, for example. That's a very common word, and likely to show up in a namespace as well...",
