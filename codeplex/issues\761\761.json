    "Description": "When there are module imports that cannot be resolved, IntelliSense will not work except for member completion\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nimport outofspace = module('doesnotexist');\r\n\r\nvar foo = 1234;\r\n\r\nfo\r\n```\r\n\r\nInvoking IntelliSense on ```fo``` doesn't return anything. However, invoking it on ```foo.``` will work",
