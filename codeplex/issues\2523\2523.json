    "Description": "Hi, \r\n\r\nTS Version: 1.01\r\nVS Version: 2013 Ultimate spring update 2014\r\n\r\nHere is the repro\r\n\r\n* Open up the attached project FooProj in visual studio.\r\n* Build the project and open up the generated declarations file \"bin\\FooProj.d.ts\"; the file should contain\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\n/// <reference path=\"../bar.d.ts\" />\r\n/// <reference path=\"../foo.d.ts\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Open bar.d.ts then save the file in order to trigger compile-on-save (you may have to save it twice).\r\n* Open up \"bin\\FooProj.d.ts\" again and observe that the file is now empty.\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour is for the file to contain the reference paths as in step 2.\r\n\r\nThis causes problems in the setup we have, because \"FooProj.d.ts\" is referenced by other projects, which start reporting compilation errors because the types in \"bar.d.ts\" and \"foo.d.ts\" are not visible.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
