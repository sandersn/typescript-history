    "Description": "Hi, as mentioned in the subject, the back and forward navigation buttons ([found on the side of a mouse](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://i.stack.imgur.com/Aizsw.png&imgrefurl=http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/32923/how-can-i-enable-the-back-button-of-a-razer-mouse&h=220&w=424&sz=16&tbnid=hede54_xA95WLM:&tbnh=90&tbnw=173&zoom=1&usg=__ZM4Yj0YeMfP940yA-ASzrT4ZNBk=&docid=-0F6QCHT4_RCJM&sa=X&ei=TvtSUubTBoSi0QWg6YCABw&ved=0CFwQ9QEwBw)) do not work in TypeScript files in Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nTheir purpose is to navigate to the last caret position.\r\n\r\nHowever, the back and forward buttons on the \"Standard\" toolbar work as expected, as do the corresponding keyboard shortcuts  Cntrl + - and Cntrl + Shift + -.\r\n\r\nThe mouse navigation buttons work correctly in C# code files.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
