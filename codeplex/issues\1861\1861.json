    "Description": "Here is a minimal repro as of 0.9.1.1:\r\n\r\n``` TypeScript\r\ninterface Args{\r\n\tcallback: (i: number) => void;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction foo(args: Args){\r\n\targs.callback(5);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfoo({\r\n\tcallback: i => 'hotdog'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n[Playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground/#src=interface%20Args%7B%0A%09callback%3A%20(i%3A%20number)%20%3D%3E%20void%3B%0A%7D%0A%0Afunction%20foo(args%3A%20Args)%7B%0A%09args.callback(5)%3B%0A%7D%0A%0Afoo(%7B%0A%09callback%3A%20i%20%3D%3E%20'hotdog'%0A%7D)%3B)\r\n\r\nThe type of `i` is inferred as `any`, which causes two problems:\r\n- No completion help when writing the `callback` function.\r\n- No compiler complaints if the function has the wrong signature/return type.\r\n\r\nThere's a good possibility this has been reported before- feel free to close if so. (There really needs to be a good way to sort between \"Confirmed\" bugs, reported bugs, and feature suggestions so its easier to check if a bug has already been reported)\r\n",
