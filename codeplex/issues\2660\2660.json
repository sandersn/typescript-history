      "Message": "Hi SARGIN,\n\nA couple points:\n\nYou may want to update your links.  The current TypeScript repo is now on GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/typescript.  You can submit issues at: https://github.com/microsoft/typescript/issues\n\nThe .js files you mention are not added to the project because they're considered not part of the project.  One way to think of it is that since TypeScript is the compiler, the source of truth is the .ts file.  The .js files are like .exe or .dll files, they're the output of the compiler, which generally isn't put in the project.\n\nHope that helps.",
