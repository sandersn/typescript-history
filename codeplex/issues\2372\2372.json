I expect that eventually all runtimes will JIT these identically anyway (it looks like Firefox does already).",

    "Description": "Currently, the typescript code\r\n```typescript\r\nfunction f(x = 0) {\r\n}\r\n```\r\ngenerates\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction f(x) {\r\n    if (typeof x === \"undefined\") { x = 0; } // instead of if (x === undefined) ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI assume that this was to avoid any possible danger of undefined being defined somewhere.\r\n\r\nI suggest this be replaced with \r\n```javascript\r\nfunction f(x) {\r\n    if (x === void 0) { x = 0; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nsince void is a keyword and void 0 will always equal the undefined value.\r\n\r\nI think this change is warranted because http://jsperf.com/typeof-vs-void-0 shows that comparing ```typeof x === \"undefined\"``` instead of ```x === void 0``` is at least marginally slower on most (all?) browsers and much slower (85% slower) on IE11.\r\n\r\nUnless there's some legacy browser that doesn't handle the void keyword correctly, I don't see any reason to keep the current behavior.\r\n",
