      "Message": "Which version of TypeScript are you using?  I'm using 0.9.5 (Beta is out currently, final release due shortly), and don't see this issue.\n\nThe key is the \":any\" type annotation on the var statement.  This ensures the expression is contextually typed as \"any\".  Otherwise the compiler cannot infer a \"best common type\" from the initializer, and an error occurs.  (Section 4.16 & 4.19 of the spec cover this).\n\nSo seems like a bug in the version you are using that we have fixed.  You can either pull the latest compiler from the \"release-0.9.5\" branch, or the final release and installer should be out shortly.",
