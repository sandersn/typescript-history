There have been some hard to track down issues with compile on save so if you happen across it again with a different set of circumstances please do file another bug or re-open this one if you find some other necessary circumstances in this case.",

    "Description": "I am experiencing some issues when trying to use compile on save after grouping my .js file underneath the .ts file. Compile on save stops working after I do so.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought that grouping the files together was the issue but it appears to be related to unloading / reloading the project.\r\n\r\nIf I close / re-open visual studio it starts working again until I unload / reload the project.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\n - Enable compile on save\r\n\r\n - Open both files (.ts and .js)\r\n\r\n - Confirm compile on save works by saving a change to the .ts file. You will be notified to reload the .js file.\r\n\r\n - Unload project\r\n\r\n - Reload project\r\n\r\n - Save a change to the .ts file. You will not be prompted to reload the .js file. Notice that the .js file does not pick up any changes in the .ts file now.",

      "Message": "What I meant by 'underneath' was just grouping the generated js file with the ts file using the \n\n    <DependentUpon></DependentUpon>\n\ntag. Sorry for the confusion. That doesn't appear to be an issue however as I can replicate the behavior without grouping them together.\n\nThere are no other additional details that I can think of that would help other than my visual studio information and typescript version. The steps to reproduce are very simple and are exactly what I listed in my initial report.\n\n**Visual Studio**\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Ultimate 2012\nVersion 11.0.60610.01 Update 3\nMicrosoft .NET Framework\nVersion 4.5.50709\n\n**Typescript**\nTypeScript for Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 and 2013 0.9.1.1\n\n-Austin\n",
