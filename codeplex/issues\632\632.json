      "Message": "I've recently been through this myself....\nBut I realized that if the code is all written in a truly OO style (i.e. no procedural code outside of a class and method), then it doesn't matter what order the code is concatenated in (except maybe in the case of some static variables, which personally I try to avoid except in the case of a singleton pattern).\nI just tell my ASP.NET bundler to include all the generated JS files into the bundle. Allows to easily debug when in debug mode (since it will just load all the original JS files), and minifies into a single JS file that still works fine when compilation debug=\"false\".",
