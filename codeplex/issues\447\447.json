      "Message": "Cut/pasting that code works fine for me, but obviously I get errors because I don't have the referenced files at the top of the code.  If it's something you can share, would you be able to attach a full repro?\n\nAs a workaround, I removed the references and added the below declaration, and all worked fine.  So maybe the referenced files are key here?\n\ninterface IValidatableObject{\n\tIsValid(): bool;\n}",
