Methods like .fullText() and .text() and .fullWidth() are great, but what about position (the same you use to report error in the form of line/column info)?\r<br />\nIs there some other kind of method I can call to get a more detailed AST?\r<br />\np.s. thanks you and all the team for your great and awesome work! <br />\n",
