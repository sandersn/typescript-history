    "Description": "**Problem**: `var strings = ['a',];` will make `strings: any[]`, even though the generated code has exactly the same semantics whether the trailing comma is present or not.\r\n\r\nI'd love to have this fixed for the following three reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It can cause nasty run-time failures that TS was designed to prevent in the first place:\r\n  * ```\r\nvar numbers: number[] = ['1',];\r\nalert('' + numbers[0].toFixed());\r\n```\r\n...surprisingly fails at run-time but should really be a compile error.\r\n\r\n1. Trailing commas are useful to keep as a feature as they produce clean diffs when appending to a list.\r\n\r\n1. It's likely caused by incorrectly inferring an `undefined` element at the end of the array, which should be easy to fix.\r\n\r\nLet me know whether you need more info, test cases or anything that could speed up fixing this.",
