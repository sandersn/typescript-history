    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe have the following error using TypeScript RC1 and Visual Studio Express 2013 :\r\n\r\nBuild fail: Cannot read files \r\n<filepath>: Unsupported file encoding\r\n\r\nThe .ts file encoding was cp1252. From what I can gather from other issues, it looks like it used to be supported. Will future TypeScript release only support source code in UTF-8 ? Can we pass an argument to the compiler so that it output in another encoding ?\r\n\r\nThanks for your great work on TypeScript. I'm trying hard to get it adopted on our project.\r\n\r\nRegards ",
