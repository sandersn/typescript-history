    "Html": "Unfortunately, I'm still finding the performance to be a major issue. It takes several minutes before the compiler builds up the information necessary to give member info, completions lists, etc. Only after it's finished that process (which has no visible indicator in the IDE) do the various functionalities happen quickly. Since 0.9, I have also been unable to reference the typings for Linq.js as it just causes the whole compiler to blow up under the pressure of all those generics. \r<br />\n<br />\nWorst of all, as of 0.9.1, Visual Studio now consumes more and more memory until it eventually crashes, even when I'm not doing anything. I <em>wasn't</em> experiencing this as of 0.9.0.1. I'm going to have to uninstall and reinstall 0.9.0.1.\r<br />\n<br />\nI don't think you guys are testing the compiler with large enough projects. I have on the order of tens of thousands of lines of TypeScript and a fairly modest use of generics, and I never get anywhere close to good performance. <br />\n",
