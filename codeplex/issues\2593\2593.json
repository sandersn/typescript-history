    "Description": "(This issue is related to [enum carrying data](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/2584).)\r\n\r\nI'd love to see switch-statements as powerful as pattern matching in functional languages. In these lanugages you can destruct the expression in the \"case\":\r\n\r\n```\r\nswitch(an_array) {\r\n  case null || undefined:\r\n    // Hm\r\n    break;\r\n  case []:\r\n    console.log(\"an empty array\");\r\n    break;\r\n  case [x, y]:\r\n    console.log(\"two elements, x = \" + x + \", and y = \" + y);  // Using x and y here from the case\r\n    break;\r\n  case [head, ...tail...]:  // Some proper syntax is needed to refer to the \"tail\" of the array\r\n    console.log(\"length of array is 1 + \" tail.length);\r\n    break;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the same way, if enums could carry any data:\r\n\r\n```\r\nswitch (an_option):\r\n  case None:\r\n    // nothing here\r\n    break;\r\n  case Some x:\r\n    console.log(\"We got \" + x);\r\n    break;\r\n  default:\r\n    // In the dream scenario, this won't be needed because of exhaustiveness checks on an_option (can only be None or Some)\r\n    break;\r\n```",
