    "Html": "I have been updating some typings for 0.9.5, and one thing that appear a lot is the use of indexers to map a dictionary.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, jquery has this piece of code that doesn't work easily anymore.<br />\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\nattr(map: { [key: <span style=\"color:Blue;\">string</span>]: <span style=\"color:Blue;\">any</span>; }): JQuery;\r\n</pre></div>To make this work, I had to cast the object to the type, like:<br />\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">var</span> attrs = &lt;{ [key: <span style=\"color:Blue;\">string</span>]: <span style=\"color:Blue;\">any</span>; }&gt; {\n   key1: value\n   key2: value\n};\n\n$(<span style=\"color:#A31515;\">&quot;selector&quot;</span>).attr(attrs);\r\n</pre></div>This is not practical, so the only thing I thought of was to change the parameter type to &quot;any&quot; in the method. This makes sense because these kinds of functions actually accept any object, but I would like to be sure what the correct solution would be.<br />\n<br />\nAm I skiping something here? Or changing the signature to accept any is this the way to go?<br />\n",
