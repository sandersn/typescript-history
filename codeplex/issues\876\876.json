    "Description": "I've installed TypeScript for VS 2010 using the method described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14510511/how-can-i-install-typescript-with-visual-studio-2010-and-vista). I use a dark theme while programming (easier on the eyes) and although I can change the syntax colors for every type of element, I can't find the setting that controls the colors of operators. Currently they are a default \"green blue\", and there is no such setting in my VS Fonts and Colors panel. __You need to honor the Script Operator color instead of using the green-blue color.__\r\n\r\n![Image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UcJsu.png)\r\nThis is what it currently looks like.\r\n\r\nJust FYI, the settings that control typescript element colors are (under Fonts and Colors):\r\n\r\n* Script Comment\r\n* Script Function Block Start\r\n* Script Identifier\r\n* Script Keyword\r\n* Script Number\r\n* Script Operator\r\n* Script String",
