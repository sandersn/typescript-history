    "Html": "I encounter some weird issue when launching my TypeScript solutions (it happens even with the default solution which comes along when creating a new TypeScript project in visual-studio). Sometimes (it happens very often), when i launch my TypeScript solution (with IE), it takes quite a while to load (i just get a blank white page for around 10-15 seconds, and after that the start page is loaded). In the output window of VS2013, i can see that the reason for that is because there was a timeout in reading few of the source-map files (image is attached).&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://imageshack.com/a/img838/3037/m4kz.png\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n<br />\nDoes anyone knows why it happens? Ever happened to anyone? it is very annoying... :-(<br />\nAny help will be much appreciated.<br />\n<br />\nI'm using Win8 / VS2013 / TS 0.9.5 / IIS Express (Just to emphasize again - it happens &quot;just-like-that&quot;, i didn't change any config files or system configurations... I just installed VS2013 with Service Pack 1 - then installed TS 0.9.5 - then created a new TypeScript project, and i just keep getting those timeouts...)<br />\n<br />\nThanks! <br />\n",
