    "Description": "The three.js library can't be correctly translated into a `.d.ts` file in Typescript 0.9.5. A simplified version of the problem:\r\n\r\n``` Typescript\r\ndeclare class A {\r\n    static Utils: {\r\n      x() : any;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ndeclare class B extends A {\r\n    static Utils: {\r\n      // completely independent from A.Utils, doesn't define x()\r\n      y() : any;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is Typescript requires `B.Utils` to be a superset of `A.utils`. I am very new to Typescript so I hesitate to make language suggestions, but it seems like this requirement could be removed for static class properties?\r\n\r\nI've worked around this for now by defining `x()` on `B`, but that is essentially bypassing the type system, since `B.Utils.x` doesn't actually exist in the external library.",
