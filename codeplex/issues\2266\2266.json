    "Description": "I would routinely love to make use of the \"someFunc(public someParam, ....\" syntax, to prevent having to also type out the object properties a second time (by using the \"public\" modifier), but TypeScript's JSDoc support falls short in this regard, and prevents the usefulness of this, make it a pointless feature if documentation is desired (and shouldn't it always be?).  For instance, consider this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass A {\r\n    /** Constructs the object.\r\n    * @param {string} a A\r\n    * @param {string} b B\r\n    */\r\n    constructor(public a: string, public b: string) { }\r\n}\r\nvar a = new A(\"1\", \"2\");\r\na.a // no help\r\na.b // no help\r\n```\r\n([http://goo.gl/TZct9Q](http://goo.gl/TZct9Q))\r\n\r\nTyping \"new A(\" shows the help tips, but when typing \"a.a\", no help is given.  What's the point if developers cannot also have the help show for the object instance properties?  I realize that this transcodes down to JavaScript, but TS does CREATE the properties for the parameters, which don't yet exist, so why not also simply COPY those comments WITH the parameters?  I'm developing an API where I create objects internally and return them (allowing the end users to directly create those objects directly as well). In such case, help is needed (and expected) in both situations.  For now, I'm forced to create the properties and duplicate comments, and forget about that ability altogether.",
