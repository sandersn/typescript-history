    "Description": "I have a fairly large project with around 200 ts files. Every time i edit a file the CPU goes through the roof and my editor starts lagging. I don't even have to save, just type a line of code. When i do save the file the CPU maxes out again even though i have compile on save disabled. \r\n\r\nI have tried to disable all formatting options to no avail.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nThomas",

      "Message": "Thanks for the update. If you are able to share the project that would definitely be helpful for isolating the issue. You can share it with us privately rather than post a public link if that's an issue. My profile has a Contact link you can use. If that's not possible we can maybe try investigating whether you're using any public .d.ts files that are for some reason causing this issue.\n\nMy first guess would've been a formatting related issue but you've already crossed that off the list. Do you have any Visual Studio extensions installed (ex Web Essentials, Resharper, etc)? ",

Just today applied visual studio 2013 update 2 in the hope of an improvement, but got none. \n\nYou asked for public d.ts files and yes we use quite a few:\ndurandal.d.ts\nhighlight.d.ts\njasmine.d.ts\njquery.d.ts\nkendo.all.d.ts\nknockout.d.ts\nleaflet.d.ts\nrequire.d.ts\nunderscore.d.ts\nmoment.d.ts\n\nDo you need the actual files? I will try to make a slimmed down project where issue is reproduced this weekend.\n\nThanks\nThomas\n\n",

      "Message": "Thanks for the update and yes i actually found this a couple of days ago. With update 2 studio simply locked up when editing files. Removing the MS git provider removed this problem. The cpu issue remains however. I got a no to sending you the whole project, so i have begun on a repro instead. Hopefully i can recreate it in a smaller project.",
