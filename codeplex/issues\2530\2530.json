If the structure provides no candidates for what T might be then the compiler has no choice but to choose the most general thing it knows to be true (T is at least {}).",

      "Message": "In fact, typing `function fn<T extends Number>(...)` fixes it also. ;)\n\nPersonally, I think it _does_ make sense that the return 'T' should be properly typed as expected in the example (as far as the type layer goes).  I don't think a missing member is a good excuse really.  I mean, after all, interfaces don't _REALLY_ exist either. ;)\n\n\n",
