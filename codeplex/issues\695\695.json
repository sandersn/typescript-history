    "Description": "I have code that uses the readonly pseudo-properties  `RegExp.$1`, `RegExp.$2`, etc. \r\n\r\nThis of course generates the error: \r\n```\r\nThe property '$1' does not exist on value of type '{ (pattern: string, flags?: string): RegExp; new(pattern: string, flags?: string): RegExp; }'\t\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is I have not been able to find *any* workaround for this because of the combination of not being able to directly modify the *always included* lib.d.ts, which makes this declaration: \r\n\r\n```\r\ndeclare var RegExp: {\r\n    new (pattern: string, flags?: string): RegExp;\r\n    (pattern: string, flags?: string): RegExp;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand any subsequent declarations of this variable's type are not recognized/processed. \r\n\r\nAttempting to insert `declare var RegExp: any;` or `interface RegExp { $1: string ... }` anywhere does not address the error and I am unable to compile the JS code.",
