    "Description": "Starting from v0.9.1 generated definitions include reference comments. This change broke my build script, because I was copying definitions from directory were they were created to another folder. Now this makes reference point to wrong location.\r\nHaving references in definitions is a good thing, but I propose to add additional command-line option to specify output location for definition file to handle such cases.",
