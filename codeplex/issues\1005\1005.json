    "Description": "If you have a base class that defines get/set properties and a subclass that overrides the set property (but not the get property), you will not be able to access the set property in the subclass. Instead, you have to re-declare the set property on the subtype. In addition, it is not possible to actually call super.set() to call the super property.",

      "Message": "As per the spec, from a subclass you can only access base class ___member functions___ via the 'super' keyword.  Although getters and setters are implemented as functions, they appear on the object as data properties (as per standard JavaScript semantics).  Thus you cannot call a getter or setter on a base class from a derived class (at least not using 'super').\n\nI'm not clear when you say \"a subclass that overrides the set property\", followed by \"not be able to access the set property in the subclass\", followed by \"you have to redeclare the set property on the subtype\".  Could you reopen with code samples of what you are trying to achieve, this may be easier to follow.\n\nThanks.",
