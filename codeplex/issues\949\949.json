    "Description": "The \"Announcing TypeScript 0.8.3.0\" article on the TypeScript Blog page (release notes) claimed that:\r\n\r\n\"The Visual Studio support for source level debugging of TypeScript no longer requires that the files being debugged are part of the current project\".\r\n\r\nIn two different projects I have tried to include only the *.ts files in the VS project file (exclude the compiled *.js/*.map files). I compile using the AMD option and generate source map files.\r\n\r\nWhen excluding *.js/*.map files from the project files, the result is that the debugger never hits a breakpoint in the imported (AMD) modules. It hits breakpoints of the scripts that were not imported using AMD though.\r\n\r\nReally hoping for this to get fixed for Version 0.9.0.0, I really would appreciate to keep only the source code (*.ts files) in the source control. All the *.js/*.map files really pollutes the change log.",
