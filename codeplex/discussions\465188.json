This was largely just a limitation in our class design to keep it to a reasonable set to reason about, as classes in ES6 did (and I believe still do) support extends clauses that have arbitrary expressions, which was also before we added the 'typeof' keyword.  In short, it's partly historical.\r<br />\n<br />\nAfter 1.0, as we start incorporating more ES6 features, it would make sense to revisit places where other expressions \r<br />\n<br />\nThat said, what are you trying to do?  You can express these as interfaces as well.<br />\n",
