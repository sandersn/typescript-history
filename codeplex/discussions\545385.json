I've configured the project file to include the TypeScript targets file and the relevant properties and I can compile TypeScript files just fine. However, any file marked as TypeScriptCompile is not visible in the WinJS project and I can't use the Add Item dialog to add additional files (currently renaming .js to .ts by hand).\r<br />\nAny ideas?\r<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nDean<br />\n",
