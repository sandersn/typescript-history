    "Description": "I have 2 .js files produced from TypeScript using the \"___extends\" function for inheritance which is injected. See here.\n\nvar __extends = this.__extends || function (d, b) {\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    __.prototype = b.prototype;\n    d.prototype = new __();\n};\n\n\nThis has the same signature always.  When two or more files having this code are combined in the Web Essentials it is not resolved and run time errors occurs.  Either make the signature unique or alter combining scripts in Web Essentials to resolve.",
