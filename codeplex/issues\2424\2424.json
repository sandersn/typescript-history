    "Description": "Original discussion: https://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/425937\r\n\r\nHi, thanks for the great work on TypeScript. I'm liking it more than any other languages that compile to JS.\r\nI would like to suggest the following: Why not have anonymous/unnamed modules? The following code snippet totally makes sense for me to compile:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nmodule {\r\n  class Simple {\r\n\t  \r\n    constructor(public name: string) {}\r\n\r\n    greet(who: string) {\r\n      return \"Greetings \"+ who +\", I'm \"+ this.name +\"!\";\r\n    }\r\n\t \r\n    static main() {\r\n      var s = new Simple('Flynn');\r\n      console.log(s.greet(\"Program\"));  \r\n    }\r\n\t \r\n  }\r\n\t\r\n  Simple.main()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generated code should be wrapped in a closure function and not cluttering the global scope.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n(function () {\r\n\r\n // ...\r\n\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso it would be nice to have a compiler option to put everything compiled in an anonymous module so that the global namespace is not cluttered.\r\n\r\nThe above snippet is with little modification from: https://gist.github.com/3916195\r\n\r\nThanks!",
