      "Message": "I'm using exactly the same source code as you for testing, yet get a different result. I must conclude I must be doing something wrong with regards to version control. Git says I'm on the develop branch with commit 45731d9e78f9ec85bf28887b1096a7ae99d6b02a which should be OK. Is there any chance that bin/tsc.js is out of date in the repository? (I'm not on a Windows system so the Makefile doesn't work for me and I can't rebuild myself.) Anyway, feel free to close this issue; I trust your judgment. I'll just wait for next stable release which I should be able to handle. :-) Sorry for taking your time.",
