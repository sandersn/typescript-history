    "Description": "I have a project structure that looks like this:\r\napp/classes/Greeter.ts\r\napp/AppMain.ts \r\n \r\nIn AppMain if I say:\r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport gt = module(\"app/classes/Greeter\");\r\n```\r\nthen the project compiles and I get correct completion lists off of gt. At runtime however I get a null ref exception off of gt as it can't find a Greeter.ts to load. If I add a new item at\r\napp/app/classes/Greeter.ts\r\nthen this import statement works at runtime as the path suggests would be the case.\r\n \r\nIf I instead say:\r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport gt = module(\"classes/Greeter\");\r\n```\r\nthen everything works as expected as design time and runtime.\r\n \r\nOf course a completely wrong path gives me the compilation error I'd expect, ex:\r\n```\r\nimport gt = module(\"foo/classes/Greeter\");\r\n```\r\n \r\nI expect the first case should've given me a compilation error as well. \r\n",
