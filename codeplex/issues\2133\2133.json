    "Description": "If you specify a TypeScriptOutDir then the compile on save will not work, but it will compile on build. I have tried the following:\r\n\r\n* Use absolute path in TypeScriptOutDir \r\n* Use relative path in TypeScriptOutDir\r\n* Use relative with project directory \"$(ProjectDir)\\script\" as suggested on item [2101](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/2101?ProjectName=typescript)\r\n* With and without the js included in project\r\n\r\nI am happy to provide more details if required.",
