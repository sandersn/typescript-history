<div class="wikidoc"><h1><b>Project Guidelines</b></h1>
<h2>Creating New Issues</h2>Please follow the following guidelines when creating new bugs in the <a href="http://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic">Issue Tracker</a>. (See also <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000029.html">Painless Bug Tracking</a>.)
<ul><li>Search the Issue Tracker to see if the bug has already been reported.</li>
<li>Use a descriptive title that identifies the bug.</li>
<li>Provide a detailed description of the bug. </li>
<li>Describe the expected behavior and the actual behavior. </li>
<li>Attach a simple project that can be built and run to reproduce the bug. </li>
<li>Include any relevant error messages and stack traces. </li>
<li>Attach any relevant log or trace files.</li>
<li>Subscribe to notifications for the created issue in case there are any follow up questions. </li></ul>

<h2>Triage Process</h2>We&#39;ll be using the following process to triage bugs in the <a href="http://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic">Issue Tracker</a>:
<ol><li>New bugs are opened with the <b>Proposed</b> state. </li>
<li> During triage, we&#39;ll assign bugs to a specific release or to the backlog for future work. We&#39;ll also assign a developer. </li>
<li>Once the bug fix has been submitted, the developer will change the status to <b>Fixed</b> and assign it to <b>Unassigned</b>.</li>
<li>The person who opened the bug should verify the fix, and mark it as <b>Closed</b>. Our QA team will also verify the bug fix. </li></ol>
We will run regular triage meetings with the project team. If there is a bug you feel strongly about but it hasnâ€™t yet been triaged, please start a <a href="http://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions">discussion</a>.<br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
