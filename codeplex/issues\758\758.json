    "Description": "lib.d.ts has the following definition:\r\n\r\ndeclare var IDBKeyRange: {\r\n    prototype: IDBKeyRange;\r\n    new(): IDBKeyRange;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe problem is that IDBKeyRange doesn't support a constructor, so my app fails if I do new IDBKeyRange(). When JS expects is IDBKeyRange.only(), but that gives a compilation error, since it's not exposed in lib.d.ts",
