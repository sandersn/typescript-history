    "Description": "I installed VS2013 and TypeScript RC1. Created a TypeScript project, added a few .ts files, set the Module System project setting to None. Everything fine.\r\n\r\nThen I turned \"Combine JavaScript output into file\" on. What I noticed was that from that point on TypeScript intellisense stopped working. The type and member dropdowns at the top get frozen in the \"(refreshing...)\" state.\r\n\r\nIs this a know issue or am I doing something wrong?",
