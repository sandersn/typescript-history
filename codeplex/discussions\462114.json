While several branches seem to be actively progressing, there doesn't seem to be any hint regarding VS 2013 RTM.  If there won't be a new release, do you have any guidance for when the next release might be?  Ryan Cavanaugh posted on September 25 that the 0.9.2 release schedule was changed, but there hasn't been any further information since then and no blog posts since the RC two weeks before that.\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks for your work on this great language!<br />\n",

It has something to do with a generic base class. [Critical]<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nWhen an interface extends two further generic interfaces, the IDE gets its knickers in a twist and prints out red squigglies all over the place, but the code compiles fine [Nuisance]<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nThey are both difficult to reproduce and it will take half a day of my time to sit down and sort that out. I don't want to spend that time only to find that it has been fixed already.<br />\n",
