    "Description": "Probably related to #1347, the answer there was to save the file in UTF-8 encoding rather than ANSI.\r\n\r\nSo when I have a character like __Ã __ in my file, you expect me to go to _File -> Save As... -> Save with Encoding..._ to satisfy the compiler?\r\nVisual Studio should be saving files as UTF-8 regardless, but it doesn't, and since Visual Studio is the most common environment for TypeScript, the compiler should be able to handle this.\r\n\r\n__Update__\r\nThe source of the problem is the default encoding of a TS file.\r\nFor example, the default encoding of a C# class is UTF-8 because ```C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\\Common7\\IDE\\NewFileItems\\csharpclass.cs``` is encoded in UTF-8.\r\nThe default encoding of a TS file is ANSI, because ```C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\\Common7\\IDE\\NewScriptItems\\file.ts``` is encoded in ANSI.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the default encoding of app.ts in the TS project template should be fixed.",
