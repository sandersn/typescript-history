      "Message": "I would be nice to have a better granularity.  Currently, you can build all .ts files into a single .js file for a whole project.  I would like to group and create more than one .js file, but not one per .ts file.  Let say... one \"grouped\" file per folder.  That way I could separate my code in different files (like the one-class-per-file rule in C#), but creating only one big .js file is just too much for me.",
