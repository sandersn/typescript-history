      "Message": "Hi Christopher, i've got an asp.net web api project with an silverlight frontend and a html5/javascript one. The silverlight app is added to the project using project properties -> silverlight applications -> add. So thats why I needed Silverlight debugging. I'm putting both the silverlight and html5/js/TypeScript clients in one project because deployment is easier.",
