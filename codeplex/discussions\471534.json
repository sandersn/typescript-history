Furthermore, our use of the @class tag was causing JSDoc to crash.<br />\n<br />\nI've seen a few &quot;TSDoc&quot; projects out there, but they all seem very incomplete.<br />\n<br />\nI'm very interested in what others are doing to create documentation from their codebases... particularly because I have to ship API docs in the very near future.<br />\n",
