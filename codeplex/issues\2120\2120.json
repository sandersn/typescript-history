    "Description": "Some code navigation using the Eclipse plugin has been getting worse going from 0.9.1.1 to 0.9.5. I've already logged this with the plugin owner (https://github.com/palantir/eclipse-typescript/issues/113), but he thinks this is probably a regression with the Ts language service.\r\n\r\n1.\r\nimport Menu = require('src/components/menu/Menu');\r\n\r\nWith 0.9.1.1 I can control/cmd click on the require file path and it takes me to the file.\r\nWith 0.9.5 it does nothing.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nthis.menu = new Menu()\r\n\r\nWith 0.9.1.1 I can control/cmd click on the class and it takes me to the class definition.\r\nWith 0.9.5 it takes me to the import statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
