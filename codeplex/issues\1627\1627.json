    "Description": "On Windows (8 in my case, node.js 0.10.17), the TypeScript compiler (tsc) does not provide a `--watch` switch. watchFile works fine in node.js and yet it's set to null in the TypeScript compiler which, for some reason, prefers to use FileSystemObject for file operations instead of the methods in the `fs` namespace, which as best I can tell work just fine.\r\n\r\nIn summary, when using FileSystemObject, you're setting the watchFile interface method to null (why?), which means the command-line TypeScript compiler loses a whole lot of its utility.",
