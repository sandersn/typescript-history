    "Description": "The typical JavaScript pattern for handling _this_ mismatches is to create a local variable called something like  __this_ or _self_ and reference these variables from the code.\r\n\r\nTypeScript uses a similar pattern if Lambda functions are used _in the constructor_ by creating its own _this variable to implement the same pattern. However, the _this generated is local to the constructor only, and cannot be referenced by our TypeScript class functions.\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n1. There is no way to guarantee 'this' outside the constructor, but Intellisense types it as the class type in class methods. This is incorrect.\r\n2. There is no way to bypass this behaviour (e.g. to save a _this variable yourself), as any reference to that variable has to use 'this' - which is not guaranteed.\r\n3. It leads to situations where __all the code is in the constructor__, so that the this value can be relied upon. This suggests the ECMAscript 6 specification is VERY broken.\r\n\r\nI propose that some way of getting a guaranteed \"this\" value should be defined. I realise this might be outside the ECMAscript 6 proposals, but in it's absence TypeScript is somewhat broken.\r\n\r\nThe chosen identifier/reserved word could be anything, perhaps _@this_ which allows the coder to access the _this created in the constructor? for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MyClass {\r\n  MyVal = \"someval\";\r\n  MyFunc() {  return @this.MyVal; } // guaranteed to be this instance\r\n}\r\n```\r\n[with thanks to CaptainN for the suggestion]",
