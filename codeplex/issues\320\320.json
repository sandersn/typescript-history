    "ClosedComment": "Thanks for the suggestion. We've decided not to do this because the odds that a complete program compiles with exactly zero expressions accessing the member either through an `any` expression or through regular JS code are very low, and the runtime experience would be terrible (you'd simply end up with an 'undefined' value and no way of knowing that it was because you did something that turned an expression into an `any` somewhere in the program), and there's no way for the compiler to even detect that you got yourself into that state. There are a ton number of downstream problems that make this unworkable at scale.",

    "Description": "I understand that when in ES5 mode, JavaScript property accessors can be created by using the get/set syntax in class definitions. However, it would be nice if in non-ES5 mode, it simply generated equivalent functions. For example:\r\n\r\nIf we have a class:\r\n\r\nclass Person {\r\n    firstName: string;\r\n    lastName: string;\r\n    get fullName() { return this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName; }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn ES5 mode, it would generate the appropriate Object.defineProperty statements, but in regular mode would generate:\r\n\r\nvar Person = (function () {\r\n    function Person() { }\r\n    Person.prototype.getFullName = function () {\r\n        return this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName;\r\n    };\r\n    return Person;\r\n})();\r\n\r\nand a statement such as:\r\n\r\nvar name = person.fullName;\r\n\r\nWould generate:\r\n\r\nvar name = person.getFullName();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
