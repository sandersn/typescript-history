    "Description": "\r\nWhen compiling a script (main.ts) that imports another module (dependency.ts):\r\n\r\n* typescript 0.9.5 used to take as input the definition file (dependency.d.ts) when available.\r\n* since 1.0.x, it seems like typescript always compiles dependency.ts even when a definition file is available. \r\n\r\nThis significantly slows down compilation for most projects.\r\n\r\nIs there a workaround? Or is it possible to have a compilation argument to opt for the old behavior.",
