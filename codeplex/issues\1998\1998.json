    "Description": "It seems that there are some layout problems on the new project properties page of TypeScript 0.9.5. Text in the following controls is cut partially off:\r\n-All section headers.\r\n-Drop down menu text for choosing ECMA script version.\r\n-\"Combine JavaScript output\" label.\r\n-\"Redirect JavaScript output\" label.\r\n-\"Specify root directory of sou...\" label.\r\n-\"Speciy root directory of Typ...\" label.\r\n\r\nI am experiencing the problem on a Surface Pro. First I thought it had something to do with display scaling (high resolution on small display), but it was the same when I turned it down.\r\n\r\nI have attached a screenshot of the project properties page illustrating the problem.",
