    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm greatly enjoying moving to typescript; coming from a strongly-typed background (Java) I like how much the compiler can do for me.\r<br />\n<br />\nOne thing that would be very helpful would be an 'overrides' annotation.  In Java, the optional <code>@override</code> annotation tells the compiler that the given function either overrides a superclass's function, or implements an interface function.\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nFor example:<br />\n<pre><code>class Animal { \n\n public makeSound(): string { return &quot;squeak&quot;; }\n}\n\nclass Dog extends Animal { \n  \n  @override\n  public makeSound(): string { return &quot;woof&quot;; }\n}</code></pre>\n\nThe advantage is that the compiler can use this annotation to check for mistakes.  If the function claims to override a super implementation, but doesn't, then the coder has probably got the function name wrong.  And vice versa; if there is a function which overrides a super, but isn't marked as an override, then that could be a sign that the coder has inadvertently overridden without meaning to.\r<br />\n<br />\nDoes typescript have any annotation support, and are there plans for something like this?  It's a real help in maintaining clean code.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nAlastair<br />\n",
