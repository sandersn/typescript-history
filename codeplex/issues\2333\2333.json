    "Description": "I'm using TypeScript in node.js and it is mildly annoying to have all the browser types in scope of the node.js code. \r\n\r\nIt comes from `lib.d.ts`. Stuff like `Window` and `DOMElement` are not used a lot but terms like `Selection` shadow our own imports. \r\n\r\nMaybe some form of environment selector could be in order at some point?",
