    "Description": "Hello, I've completed rewritting my javascript framework in typescript. Now I'm trying to use these files in many other web projects. \r\n\r\nI've tried linking (Linked File) them into the web project. First thing I noticed, I can't change the Build Action to \"TypeScriptCompile\". .ts files are compiled in their source folder, not where they are linked. The problem is that when creating a new file .ts file in web project, it doesn't see the linked files and I get a TypeScript error. \r\n\r\nAlso, everytime I try to build a project with Linked TypeScript Files, it crashes Visual Studio. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any idea ?\r\n\r\nHere's a link to the same question on StackOverflow: \r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/17900825/typescripts-linked-files-are-unseen-by-current-projects-typescript-files\r\n\r\nThanks !",

I can add error causing code to your Typescript files and the solution still compiles successfully. This might explain why you're not seeing the TypescriptCompile action do what you think. \n\nI changed your 'module' to 'require' in app.ts and now the linked lib\\library.ts file is being resolved correctly and I get the Intellisense experience I expect even without the /// reference.
