Unfortunately, I have yet to discover a way to accomplish this in TypeScript, so I resorted to a small library called\r\n<a title=\"jTypes\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/jTypes\" target=\"_blank\">jTypes</a>&nbsp;instead. But hopefully someone can shed some light on this question, because I would like to know the answer as well since some of my other projects are still relying on TypeScript.</p>\r\n",
