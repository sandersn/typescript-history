    "Description": "Sometimes IE will catch an runtime in my generated JS file and pull up that file in the editor.  I forget that it's the JS file and not the TS file, and I start to make edits to it, then they get overwritten and I lose my work.  Make the output JS file read only so I can't do that by mistake.",
