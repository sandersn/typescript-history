    "Description": "hi there... when debugging arrow functions using chrome, we're noticing that the value of \"this\" is wrong... it's pointing to the window object instead of the outer function \"this\"... is this an issue with chrome? or is this an issue with TS source maps? not sure where the problem lies or how to resolve... thank you\r\n\r\n\r\n      private loadPrograms(): IPromise<entities.Program[]> {\r\n               if (!this.model)\r\n                return this.promiseService.when(null);\r\n\r\n            var programId = this.selectedProgramId;\r\n\r\n            if (this.model.networkId && this.model.startDate && this.model.endDate && this.model.startTime && this.model.endTime) {\r\n                var startDateTime = moment(moment(this.model.startDate).format(\"M/D/YYYY\") + moment(this.model.startTime).format(\" h:m:s A\"));\r\n                var endDateTime = moment(moment(this.model.endDate).format(\"M/D/YYYY\") + moment(this.model.endTime).format(\" h:m:s A\"));\r\n                return this.domainContext.getAvailablePrograms(this.model.networkId, startDateTime.toDate(), endDateTime.toDate()).then(list => {\r\n                    this.programs = list; //when debugging \"this\" points to Window...\r\n                    if (programId && !this.programs.some(o => o.id === programId)) {\r\n                        this.selectedProgramId = null;\r\n                    }\r\n                    return this.programs;\r\n                });\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                this.selectedProgramId = null;\r\n            }\r\n        }",

      "Message": "i just wanted to add that at runtime things work fine... the js code is fine and works... it's just that debugging the TS files in chrome through source maps is a problem with arrow functions and \"this\"... the workaround for now is to add a watch to \"_this\" but this is not ideal... thanks again",

    {
      "Message": "Note: I believe I had this exact same issue.  It was Chrome returning the value of \"this\", not knowing that \"this\" actually maps to \"_this\", so I kept having to manually enter \"_this\" in the watches.  I'm guessing the issue is still there.  I believe I experienced this in the built-in IE debugger as well, but not sure.",
