    "Description": "The error \"The symbol 'any' is not visible at this point\" is a side affect from the actual error which can be reproduced with this code:\r\n\r\ndeclare var v: any;\r\nmodule APP\r\n{\r\n\tvar func;\r\n\tfunction func()\r\n\t{\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe culprit is \"func\" being declared as a var and then a function. In the TypeScript playground this code will make it so any use of 'any' will be an error, and in Visual Studio it breaks all TypeScript intellisense.",
