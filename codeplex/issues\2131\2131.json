    "ClosedComment": "giancarloa is correct, this is by design. TypeScript compares types by their shape (ie structural typing), not their name (ie nominal typing), which matches how JavaScript behaves. In practice you wouldn't write types this simple, your derived types of Animal would have distinguishing members that would make a Snake not assignable to a Horse. ",

    "Description": "Consider the example below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Animal {\r\n    constructor(public name: string) { }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Snake extends Animal {\r\n    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Horse extends Animal {\r\n    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar sam: Horse = new Snake(\"Sammy the Python\"); // whoops!\r\nvar tom: Animal = new Horse(\"Tommy the Palomino\");\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be possible to assign Snake into Horse, but tsc 0.9.5.0 doesn't complain about this.",
