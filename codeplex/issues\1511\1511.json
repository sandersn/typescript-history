    "Description": "Can you point me to a single JavaScript file somewhere which will accept a TypeScript input string and return the converted JavaScript output as a string but which is independent of a specific HTML-based editor and of the DOM yet is written in JavaScript (not TypeScript or the command line)?\r\n\r\n(Or, if the responsible source file is itself written in TypeScript, I would appreciate knowing what steps to take to convert the necessary file or files by the command line tools.)\r\n\r\nI'd like to possibly incorporate any such JS code into my Firefox add-on which currently only handles CoffeeScript conversions: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/french-press/ Thanks!",
