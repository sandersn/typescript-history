    "Html": "typescript-tools (v0.2.0) provides access to the TypeScript Language Services (v0.9) via a simple commandline server (<code>tss</code>). This makes it easy to build editor/IDE plugins supporting TypeScript (when your editor is not itself running JavaScript). \r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/clausreinke/typescript-tools\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/clausreinke/typescript-tools</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nSupported features (via TS language service) include:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>resolving dependencies (via <code>TypeScript.ReferenceResolver</code>)</li>\n<li>type and documentation lookup</li>\n<li>find definition, list references</li>\n<li>identifier completion</li>\n<li>\nlist load, syntax, and semantic errors<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nA Vim plugin (tss.vim) is included. Some users are working on Emacs (linked) and Sublime (not published yet) plugins. If you build plugins for other editors/IDEs based on typescript-tools, please let me know, or better: announce them on our new project mailing list.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe protocol used by <code>tss</code> (commands over stdin, JSON over stdout) is outlined on the project home page, as are the Vim plugin commands. For changes since tss v0.1.0, see file <a href=\"https://github.com/clausreinke/typescript-tools/blob/master/CHANGES.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">CHANGES.txt</a>.\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope you'll find this useful. The sources might be interesting as an example of using the language services (though I do not guarantee that they are a good example!-).<br />\n",
