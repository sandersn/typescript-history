      "Message": "I doubt we'll create a repl, at least in the near future.  The thought here is that TypeScript is a thin shim on JavaScript to help you built out large applications.  We're not trying to build a full stack, environment, etc, to go along with that, but rather build a compiler that can fit in your toolchain.\n\nThat said, it may not be terribly difficult, since the TypeScript compiler is already loadable from JS, to build something like this.",
