    "Html": "\r\n<p>Background: We use TS without almost any HTML markup, the UI is created by TS code and hence we frequently assign CSS classes to HTML elements.</p>\r\n<p>Needed: a tighter integration between CSS and TS. VS studio could automatically generate some kind of resource map file, perhaps similar to the R class in Android. There would be a new type “CssClass” so the compiler could catch incorrect function calls.\r\n Intellisense would then allow you to start typing like “R.Cs” this would expand to “R.CssClasses.”, and then you would perhaps get a list of matching classes. The resource map could also include all images in a project.</p>\r\n<p>Just an idea…</p>\r\n<p>---bjorn</p>\r\n",
