This content was lifted from an existing repo we had for a while, but it is now integrated with the rest of our information.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnd this is where we'd value your contributions:\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you know cool projects, tools or libraries that relate to TypeScript then please go ahead and send Pull Request with new links.\r<br />\n<br />\nThere is a <a href=\"http://definitelytyped.org/pages/website-contributions.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">content contribution guide</a> on the site. \r<br />\n<br />\nYou can even add links without leaving your browser if you use the code editor on Github.com (it is a crappy widget but will do for some markdown editing).\r<br />\n<br />\nLooking forward to your visits and maybe some new links :)<br />\n",
