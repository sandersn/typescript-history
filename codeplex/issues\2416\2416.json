    "Description": "hello... one issue that still has not been fixed with TS is that on occasion when trying to rename refactor we continue getting the error \"rename task took more than 2 second... try later\"... i have attached a screenshot example... any ideas on how to fix this? after enough restarts, prayer, and hail marys, it eventually works but it's terribly annoying... i think 2 seconds is an unreasonable limit for some code bases... it all depends on what you are renaming... is there any way to bump this limit up??? thanks again...",
