    "Description": "I started out by asking for help on StackOverflow, http://bit.ly/Uu4dpd.  But I guess this would probably be a better place for it.\n\nWe are using Typescript 0.8.1.0, and we have run into a situation where Visual Studio crashes while debugging in Internet Explorer. It happens as soon as we load a page with javascript. This is the error:\n\nProblem Event Name: CLR20r3\n  Problem Signature 01: devenv.exe\n  Problem Signature 02: 11.0.51106.1\n  Problem Signature 03: 5098c6d7\n  Problem Signature 04: TypeScriptDebugEngine\n  Problem Signature 05: 0.8.1.0\n  Problem Signature 06: 50a1a534\n  Problem Signature 07: 2c\n  Problem Signature 08: 11a\n  Problem Signature 09: System.IndexOutOfRangeException\n  OS Version:   6.2.9200.2.0.0.272.7\n  Locale ID:    1033\n  Additional Information 1: 405e\n  Additional Information 2: 405e61bb034bc989d1c165b6e791ea8b\n  Additional Information 3: 40a4\n  Additional Information 4: 40a44cd3ba2d99a4ae774300b848d2cc\nHere are the versions of the components we are running\n\nInternet Explorer version: 10.0.9200.16384.\nVisual Studio: Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2012, Version 11.0.51106.01 Update 1\nTypescript: 0.8.1.0\nI have tried running this with all other extensions disabled but to no avail. We were not experiencing this issue with 0.8.0.0. I thought that it may have something to do with source maps, but we have not generated any and we are not using the source maps switch. We are able to debug the application in Chrome without any issues.\n\nOutside of this information, I am at a loss for what else to add.  Let me know what other information would be helpful.  \n\nThanks for the help.\n\n",

      "Message": "The solution to my problem was found here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/13813441/367611.  Basically, Web Essentials had created some .map files that were interfering with the TypeScriptDebugEngine.  Even though Web Essentials has been disabled, the .map files were still there.  Deleting those fixed the issue.  I don't know if this should still be considered a bug, so I will leave it open for you guys to decide.  Thanks!",
