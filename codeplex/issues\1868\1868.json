    "Description": "I like how a main focus of the TypeScript team is to keep the JS output as readable as possible. I think it may have been key in TypeScripts success so far.\r\n\r\nOne thing I've always disliked though, is the translation of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule ns1.ns2.ns3 {\r\n    // code\r\n}\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar ns1;\r\n(function (ns1) {\r\n    (function (ns2) {\r\n        (function (ns3) {\r\n            // code\r\n        })(ns2.ns3 || (ns2.ns3 = {}));\r\n        var ns3 = ns2.ns3;\r\n    })(ns1.ns2 || (ns1.ns2 = {}));\r\n    var ns2 = ns1.ns2;\r\n})(ns1 || (ns1 = {}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThought: I'm not an JS memory expert, but don't the extra closures and additions to the call stack waste memory?\r\n\r\nBut, more importantly, couldn't this be made more readable by translating it to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar ns1;\r\n(function( ns1, ns2, ns3) {\r\n    // code\r\n})( ns1 || (ns1 = {}), ns1.ns2 || (ns1.ns2 = {}), ns2.ns3 || (ns2.ns3 = {}) );\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou get the advantages of a locally scoped variable, but keep the readable left-to-right-flow of the namespacing.\r\n\r\nNow, if in the compiler parses the above TypeScript as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule ns1 {\r\n    module ns2 {\r\n        module ns3 {\r\n            // code\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n...I guess it's not an easy fix.",
