I agree it can lead to some unfortunate errors but this (scoping and the context of 'this') is just a concept that a JS/TS developer must be familiar with. See this thread for some discussion on the issue: https://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/429350",

    "Description": "``` TS\r\nclass A {\r\n\tconstructor(public x : string) {\r\n\t\tx = \"1\";\r\n\t\tthis.x = \"1\";\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nnew A(\"1\");\r\n```\r\nis compiled to\r\n``` JS\r\nvar A = (function () {\r\n    function A(x) {\r\n        this.x = x;\r\n        x = \"1\";\r\n        this.x = \"1\";\r\n    }\r\n    return A;\r\n})();\r\n\r\nnew A(\"1\");\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany developers can assume that \"x\" in the constructor body is a field of this class. But actually any usage of 'x' without 'this' qualifier refer to constructor argument which is just a local variable, so any modification of it doesn't affect field value (look at the compiled JS).\r\nMy suggestions:\r\n* Disallow modifications of field without \"this\". You can write this.x = 100, but not x = 100; \r\n* Or treat any usages of \"x\" as \"this.x\" in constructor body, so modification of \"x\" will cause modification of a field not a local variable/argument.\r\n",

That thread discuss omitting \"this\" in general case (and I agree that is something that should not be done), and this issue deals with a particular case where compiler doesn't give an error when a field-related parameter is used without \"this.\". Please read the issue again.",
