    "Description": " I am using 0.9 preview. However, whenever I write something in a try catch block, intellisense  gone completely in the TS file, while others TS file are still having intellisense, as long as I don't write anything inside the try catch block. \r\n\r\nCreating a new try catch block with empty content will also trigger the same problem.\r\n\r\nReloading the file or the solution won't fix the problem.\r\n\r\nThe only way to restore intellisense is to restart VS IDE.\r\n\r\nNow I have to be very careful and write a try catch block in Programmer's Notepad and then copy/paste back to VS IDE. Odd and troublesome.\r\n\r\n:(",
