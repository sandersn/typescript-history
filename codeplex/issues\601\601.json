      "Message": "TouchDevelop uses it's own language syntax that is heavily influenced by it's goal of providing a great touch-focused development experience.  The TypeScript language isn't designed with this as a primary goal, so the specific approaches used by TouchDevelop aren't likely to be a direct fit for TypeScript.  We do expect to improve the usability of the Playground further on tablet devices, but don't expect to go as far as the input model TouchDevelop uses.  For that, TouchDevelop itself is a great choice.",
