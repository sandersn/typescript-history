    "Description": "Hi, this bug is related to [work item #2116](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/2116) and will probably be fixed with that issue. Reporting it here because it may provide some insight into those cases where compile-on-save fails to work, [as reported previously](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/2046).\r\n\r\nHere are the steps to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\nTS Version: 0.9.5\r\nVisual Studio Version: VS 2013 Ultimate.\r\n\r\n`\r\n1. Add a TypeScript project and TypeScript file FooBar.ts with class FooBar.\r\n2. Close all documents.\r\n3. Perform a find in files for \"FooBar\".\r\n4. Click on the found result, so that FooBar.ts is opened in the document well.\r\n5. Ensure compile on save works on this file.\r\n6. Open up the same file by clicking on FooBar.ts in the solution explorer.\r\n   [Because of bug #2116](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/2116) this opens up a second file.\r\n7. Esure compile on save works on the second file..\r\n8. Close the ___first___ FooBar.ts (the one opened from Find-in-files).\r\n9. Now compile on save fails to work on the remaining file.\r\n\r\nLet me know if the repro fails - I might be able to provide a project.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
