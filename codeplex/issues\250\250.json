    "Description": "This is a low-priority one but anyhow. The spaces in Javascript are missing after tsc compilation from several language constucts like if (...), for (...) and maybe others as well.\r\n\r\nInstead of \"if (\" and \"for (\"  the compile emits \"if(\" and \"for(\"\r\n\r\nThis contradicts the way formatting has been defined in Javascript (and almost any language having similar structures).  Removing spaces is OK in minification/compression but the spaces should probably be there after compilation.\r\n",
