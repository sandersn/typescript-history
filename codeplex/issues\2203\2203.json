But when compiling on the command line, it's not.\r\n\r\nThe require statement actually breaks the app because util does not have the express module available, so when it tries to run the require statement it bombs.\r\n\r\nI am using TypeScript 0.9.5",

I.e. the express import is removed in both cases, since it's only reference in a type-position. \r\n\r\nWe realize this breaks express and we're taking a look if this is actually the right thing to do in this case.\r\n\r\nThe workaround to keep the import is adding the following:\r\n\r\n````\r\nvar dummy = express;\r\n````",
