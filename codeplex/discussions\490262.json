I don't want to add compiled files into my git repository, so I configured not to add *.js files into the repository. (By adding &quot;.js&quot; to .gitignore)<br />\nHowever, after I added a library written in JavaScript, I couldn't do so. I wanted to upload the library and the library's file name ended with &quot;.js&quot;<br />\n<br />\nIf the suffix of compiled files are something different from ordinary js files, I can configure to add ordinary js files and not to add js files compiled from ts files.<br />\n",
