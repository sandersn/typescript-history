See section 3.7.5 Method Signatures in the language spec. \n\n\"A set of overloaded method signatures correspond to a declaration of a single property with a type composed from an equivalent set of call signatures.\" \n\nwhile in the case of ICar2 you have 2 properties of the same name which each are of a function type.",
