    "Description": "I have two projects, a regular web project that has typescript files, and another sharepoint-hosted 2013 app project, in the same solution. When copying the typescript item into the Scripts metafolder in the app, it breaks compilation of the app project with a \"missing app manifest message.\" The real error is because VS marks the .ts file as an App manifest. I verified by looking in the unloaded csproj:\r\n\r\n<AppManifestFile Include=\"Scripts\\app.ts\" />\r\n\r\nAlso logged here:\r\nhttps://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/789496/error-copying-a-ts-typescript-file-into-a-sharepoint-2013-apps-project\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n1) create html web project with typescript support\r\n2) create sharepoint 2013 app project (sharepoint hosted)\r\n3) copy app.ts file from project 1) into Scripts\\ in project 2)\r\n4) attempt to compile project 2), error will occur: missing app manifest.\r\n",
