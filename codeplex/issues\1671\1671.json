    "Description": "Well, this is cute:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nvar x = { a: 2, a: \"3\" };\r\nvar y: typeof x = x;\r\nvar z: typeof x = { a: 2, a: \"3\" };\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the current playground, the first error here is on the last line:  Where the object defined identically to x is not compatible with x.  I find it curious that line 2 is allowed.\r\n\r\nMouse over x to see its interface is \"{ a: number; a: string; }\"\r\n\r\nIf we allow repeated fields (and I think javascript does), then the interface of x should be \"{ a: string; }\".\r\n\r\nIf not, then there ought to be an error at the first line.",

If you still see issues with our latest bits, then please reopen.",
