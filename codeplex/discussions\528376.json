This would also provide a solution to some of the other discussion on modules and namespaces I've seen. What do you think? <br />\n",

We definitely don't want to end up painting ourselves into a corner and not being able to support all the ES6 features because of some TypeScript specific conveniences that could've been added later. There's certainly plenty of room for improvement in the module story though and we'll be looking at cases like this along with others while trying to sync up with what ES6 supports.\r<br />\n<br />\nAs far as prefixes go, the export= syntax does help in some cases with that. <br />\n",
