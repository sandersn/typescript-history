It comes down to file having crlf's in the javascript (and publishing that).\r<br />\n<br />\nSo I checked my compile output and it has crlf's (I'm on Windows)\r<br />\n<br />\nI could just forcefully remove them from the build files but then the source-map would be incorrect. Not a huge problem for production but mildly complicating.\r<br />\n<br />\nHow is this supposed to work, and is there a way to control this?<br />\n",
