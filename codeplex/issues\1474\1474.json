    "Description": "For performance reasons, I have set up my MSBuild project to build TypeScript files only when they change. This creates a problem when there is an error in a TypeScript file, because the compiler generates the output JavaScript file even when there are errors in the source. On the next build, the output file is already up-to-date, so you no longer see the error unless you have changed the source file. This results in builds that are unpredictable.\r\n\r\nDuring development, I'd love to have the option to suppress the JavaScript output if there are any errors or warnings in the source. Could that option be added to the TypeScript compiler?",
