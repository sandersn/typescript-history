    "Description": "I just encountered the problem that debugging with source maps and a HTTPS do not work on my computer.\r\nI think the problems are the self signed certificates, which I use for my web server for development.\r\nMaybe VS does not want to download the source maps from a site which has a unknown certificate.\r\n\r\nSince during development you have quite often self signed certificates and the risk with downloading a manipulated source map is quite low, is it possible to change the default behavior?",
