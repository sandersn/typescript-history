Since js obviously lacks a tuple type, these are simply fixed length arrays with types at known locations. The pattern isn't popular; I've mostly seen the\r\n pattern in parsers but with the destructuring strawman accepted for ES6, I expect the usage to increase.</p>\r\n<p>Simple example (it doesn't make a lot of sense not to add the type to the object...):</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">function</span> tokenize (source) {\n  <span style=\"color:green\">// ...</span>\n  <span style=\"color:blue\">return</span> [<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'binaryOp'</span>, {op: <span style=\"color:#a31515\">'&#43;'</span>, left: <span style=\"color:#a31515\">'2'</span>, right: <span style=\"color:#a31515\">'2'</span>}];\n  <span style=\"color:green\">// ...</span>\n}\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Trying to express the type signature of the function in obvious ways doesn't work:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<pre>(string) =&gt; [string, Token]     // first try\n(string) =&gt; {0:string, 1:token} // second try</pre>\r\n<p>From reading the language spec, it looks like the first is being used for type annotating [] property access for number vs string and the second fails because 0 and 1 aren't getting parsed as valid identifiers, nor are strings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I appreciate you working on this and open sourcing it permissively. I've been interested in providing quality completion for JS for a while and from a quick scan it looks like I might be able to get it from what's there plus some appropriate .d.ts annotations.</p>\r\n",
