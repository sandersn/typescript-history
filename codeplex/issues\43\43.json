    "Description": "Given this example: \r\n\r\n[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].map( v => this[v] = v );\r\n\r\nThe TypeScript output is:\r\n\r\n[\r\n    \"a\", \r\n    \"b\", \r\n    \"c\"\r\n].map(function (v) {\r\n    return _this[v] = v;\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich throws a ReferenceError: _this is not defined.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Traceur, the output is:\r\n\r\n[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].map((function(v) { \r\n  return traceur.runtime.elementSet(this, v, v); \r\n}).bind(this)); \r\n\r\n\r\nIgnoring the Traceur specific runtime call, the value is |this| is still correct (captured via bind()).\r\n\r\nIn another ticket, it was noted that bind() will be used whenever the target is explicitly ES5, so if this is supposed to be ES3-safe, I'd argue that you can't use [].map() in ES3. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    {
      "Message": "This is a bug, but only occurs for code at the top-level.  Putting the code sample above inside a function, class, or module will correctly cause the \"var _this = this\" to be generated.  (aside: in practice, it should also be relatively rare to need to refer to global this inside a top-level lambda, since it normally has a better name bound globally, like 'window', but this is still a bug).\n",

    {
      "Message": "Luke, I agree that it's an edge case (and one that should be avoided), but the bound name is still `_this` and that will conflict with user code.\n\nShould I file a separate ticket for the bind() & map(), ES3 v ES5 thing?",
