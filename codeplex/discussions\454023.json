Is it possible to have both types named as &quot;Event&quot;?<br />\n\r<br />\nThe problem I ran into was that the Slick.Event type is being used in the definitions file regardless if it is referenced as &quot;Slick.Event&quot; or &quot;Event&quot; since I guess it takes precedence over the lib.d.ts Event type.  Is it possible to reference the lib.d.ts Event somehow.. or what can be done?  The only option I can think of is maybe using an exports = { } and have it defined as something internal like Slick.SlickEvent and then export as Slick.Event, but I don't know if this will clash with lib.d.ts Event for the end user (and frankly I haven't wanted to give it a try yet).\r<br />\n<br />\nOK I just tried <code>typescript declare var LibEvent: typeof Event;</code> but it doesn't recognize it as a type and I can't to <code>typescript delcare var LibEvent: typeof Event = Event;</code> since this is a definitions file.  Hmm, any help is appreciated.<br />\n",
