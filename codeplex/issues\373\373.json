    "Description": "It would be nice if the TS compiler could generate named functions instead of anonymous functions for class members. \r\nNamed functions are heavily used in Debugger stacks and make debugging much easier.\r\n\r\nclass Test {\r\n    func() { }\r\n}\r\n\r\nshould become \r\n\r\nvar Test = (function () {\r\n    function Test() { }\r\n    Test.prototype.func = function func() {\r\n    };\r\n    return Test;\r\n})();",
