    "Description": "(Note: formatting lost on transfer to issue tracker.  Issue here is that same color is used for numbers and strings in TypeScript but different colors in C#)\r\n\r\nTypeScript colours numbers the same as strings - is that intentional?\r\n\r\n// TypeScript\r\n\r\nvar ilikepie =3.14159265359;\r\n\r\nvar stringpie = \"3.14159265359\";\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n// C#\r\n\r\nvar ilikepie = 3.14159265359;\r\n\r\nvar stringpie = \"3.14159265359\";\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCertainly not trying to suggest that TypeScript should try to emulate C# - but surely they can still be friends when it comes to sharing colours in the IDE?!\r\n\r\nThanks",
