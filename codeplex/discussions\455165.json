We support each release of our software for several years. That means that we will someday have multiple releases built with different versions of TypeScript. We need to be able to create patches for older releases that use an old compiler and at the same time also be able to work on newer releases that use a newer compiler. Therefore it would be great if one could select the compiler version that TypeScript uses in the Visual Studio project properties.\r<br />\n<br />\nDo you have any plans to support such a scenario in the future?\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nMathias<br />\n",
