    "Html": "I've got the following module:\r<br />\n<br />\nmodule Kiwi.Components.Math\r<br />\n<br />\n.. with a class inside of it set for export. But now I can't access the JavaScript Math object within my methods, i.e. Math.random(), Math.PI, etc. Visual Studio complains it can't find those properties on 'Math' (which I assume it's incorrectly referring to the module).\r<br />\n<br />\nIs this a VS/compiler bug? Or will it never be fixed? I.e. I need to avoid the use of 'Math' in a module name. I can understand if my module was just called &quot;Math&quot; but I was hoping the depth of it would have avoided this issue.<br />\n",

    "Html": "TypeScript follows JavaScript in its approach to scoping and shadowing.  If you have an example like this:<br />\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">module</span> MyModule {\n    <span style=\"color:Blue;\">class</span> Math {\n        <span style=\"color:Blue;\">constructor</span>() {\n            <span style=\"color:Blue;\">var</span> y = Math.cos(3);\n        }\n    }\n}\r\n</pre></div>You'll get an error because the class 'Math' is shadowing the global Math.  To avoid this shadowing, you need another way to refer to the name before it's shadowed.  For example, you could do this as a workaround:<br />\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">var</span> Math2 = Math;\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">module</span> MyModule {\n    <span style=\"color:Blue;\">class</span> Math {\n        <span style=\"color:Blue;\">constructor</span>() {\n            <span style=\"color:Blue;\">var</span> y = Math2.cos(3);\n        }\n    }\n}\r\n</pre></div>",
