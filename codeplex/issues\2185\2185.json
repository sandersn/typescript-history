    "Description": "We used to extend our file references with chutzpah-exclude=\"true\". In the latest version of TypeScript this results in an “Illegal characters in path” error. \r\nOur solution for now is adding TypeScriptRemoveComments to our csproj file, but it would be nice to have this chutzpah-exclude option back. \r\nWe like this feature this because it keeps our tests quick and light. For clarity: our test scripts are written in pure javascript and we reference the compiled javascript files in our tests.\r\n",
