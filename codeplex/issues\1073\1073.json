    "Description": "Lots of JSON that I want to create an interface declaration for uses hyphens in the name. Unfortunately, this is not allowed in an identifier.\r\n\r\nAn example is mapping to the JSON returned from the Spotify Metadata API. I can't seem to map \"artist-id\". I've tried a couple of things:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.spotify.com/technologies/web-api/\r\n\r\nexport interface Album {\r\n    //artist-id: string;\r\n    //artist\\u002did: string;\r\n    //\"artist-id\": string;\r\n    name: string;\r\n    artist: string;\r\n    //external-ids: ExternalId[];\r\n    released: string;\r\n    tracks: Track[];\r\n    href: string;\r\n    availability: Availability;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis was also brought up on stackoverflow here:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/13661144/typescripts-hashtables-and-keys-with-a-dash",
