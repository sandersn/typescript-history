    "Description": "This is a cosmetic change, but sometimes its annoying to look at the generated code, mainly when debugging without sourcemaps.\r\n\r\nGiven the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar a = \"foo\", \r\n    b = \"bar\";\r\n```\r\nTypescript renders as:\r\n```\r\nvar a = \"foo\", \"b = \"bar\";\r\n```\r\nWhich is works fine. The problem is when you are declaring lots of variables and assignments, in which case TypeScript will render a line with 400 columns that is quite hard to read.\r\n\r\nThis issue is just a request to always render var statements to JS in multiple lines, so even if you delcare:\r\n```\r\nvar a = \"foo\", \"b = \"bar\", c, d;\r\n```\r\nShould be rendered as\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar a = \"foo\", \r\n    b = \"bar\", \r\n    c,\r\n    d;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince this will be minified later anyway, won't cause any problems and will just improve readability.",
