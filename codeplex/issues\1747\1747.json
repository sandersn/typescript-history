    "Description": "Consider this commonly used pattern:\r\n```\r\nfunction f<X extends { prop: string }>( xs: X[] )  {\r\n\treturn (xs||[]).map( x => x.prop );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote how I'm protecting from null argument by saying `xs || []`. This pattern is, intuitive, clean, and most importantly widely used.\r\n\r\nThe bummer is, the compiler treats the result of this expression as `any[]` as opposed to `X[]`. Although this makes formal sense (the type result is widened to the widest type, which is `any[]`), one can easily see how it's inconvenient from the human point of view.\r\n\r\nI do realize I could say `new Array<X>()` instead of `[]`, but that is so much more verbose that it's almost not worth it.",

If you check out the latest language specification in the develop branch you'll see section 4.19 Contextual Typing is now updated to define how we choose the type for these sorts of expressions. Marking this as active for now since we haven't actually implemented the new design yet.",
