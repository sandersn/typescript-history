I considered using an MSBuild &quot;PreBuild&quot; event to automate this call for every &quot;.ts&quot; file in the project, but wanted to dig for the nice, &quot;silent&quot; generation provided by the &quot;HTML Application with TypeScript&quot; template from the TypeScript tools.\r<br />\n<br />\n*My guess after digging in, is that the TypeScript tools hook into a specific project type GUID to provide the automatic support. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the TypeScript tools source code to find out or to attempt to contribute a fix. TypeScript itself seems to be open source, but I couldn't find the tools in the open source.\r<br />\n<br />\nIt doesn't look like there is support (yet)<br />\n",
