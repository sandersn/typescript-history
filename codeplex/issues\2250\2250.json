    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nthe Node Tools for VS people have integrated NPM into their .nsproj Visual Studio projects. This provides the following functionality:\r\n\r\n* An \"npm\" system folder for each project, similar to the \"References\" folder in the existing TypeScript projects.\r\n* A right-click menu on this folder with options for installing, uninstalling or updating NPM packages.\r\n* A user interface for searching and installing packages.\r\n\r\nI've attached an image. More details to be found on [the NTVS site](https://nodejstools.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Screenshots).\r\n\r\nAt the moment TypeScript projects are based on the C# template and link up with the Nuget package manager. This is not as useful as NPM for JavaScript development.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
