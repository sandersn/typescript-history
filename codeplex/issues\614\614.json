    "Description": "Single stepping while debugging, the 'step-line' is out of alignment when crossing from one '.ts' file to another. Also, when placing contiguous breakpoints (one breakpoint in each file), the second breakpoint is not hit. A Map-File alignment issue I assume?\r\nThe attached Visual Studio project has a breakpoints set (app.ts line# 54), this should call into (canvas.ts line# 1079) '.  when you step into the canvas file from this breakpoint, the debug-highlighted line is at line# 1064 (about 16 lines above the actual step target).",
