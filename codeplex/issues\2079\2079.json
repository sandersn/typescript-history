    "Description": "I request plugins for the most popular task runners, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/), which is [getting serious traction right now](http://www.100percentjs.com/just-like-grunt-gulp-browserify-now/).\r\n\r\nThere's already a [grunt-typescript npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-typescript), but I've been having problems with it myself and I'd trust something from the TypeScript team much better. As for [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/), nobody has created one yet.\r\n\r\nOf course, this would all be much more doable if [my previous feature request to export a TypeScript.compile() for Node library usage](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/2078) was implemented.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, I'd love to hear the conversation this sparks.",

Currently I'm using 0.2.6 version of grunt-typescript (that's TS 0.9.5).\n\nThe configuration options I'm using:\n\n``` JavaScript\nmodule.exports = function(grunt) {\n  grunt.initConfig({\n    typescript: {\n      index: {\n        src: 'scripts/**/*.ts',\n        options: {\n          noImplicitAny: true,\n          allowbool: false,\n          allowimportmodule: false,\n          sourcemap: true,\n          module: 'amd',\n          target: 'es5'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  });\n};\n```",

The team is currently very focused with getting the compiler and language service completed to a high quality, and has no plans to also author \"official\" plug-ins at this point.",
