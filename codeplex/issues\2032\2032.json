    "Description": "I installed TypeScript 0.9.5 and Chutzpah 3.0 both today, but found no unit tests were dicovered by Chutzpah. and same thing happens for a very simple project. But I can run those test via right click context menu. Maybe there are some setting issues, so I attach the solution. Please take a look, thanks.\r\n\r\nAnd also I encountered a performance issue after installed Chutzpah, VS became slow response when I edited several type script files. I am not sure if this is related to Chutzpah. VS works fine if I restart VS, but some time later, performance will be very bad.",
