    "Description": "I have created a project using VS 2012 + TypeScript 0.81 and copied all the files and folders from an old project. Then I assigned TypeScriptCompile to all *.ts files.\n\nWhen I compile the project, I get a strange error and what is more serious is that map files and js files do not belong to the correct ts files. See attachment js/GameView/WebGL.* or lib/definitions/jazz.d.*",

      "Message": "This is a bug we're fixing in the next release, but I wanted to let you know the work-around for now -- the root cause here is case sensitivity issues. You have some files named e.g. \"helping.ts\" that are referenced in the _reference.ts files as \"Helping.ts\" (note the case difference). If you fix up all the _reference.ts files to have the same casing as the actual files, you won't see the confusing \"wrong extension\" errors anymore. Thanks for reporting this!",
