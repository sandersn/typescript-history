    "Description": "When I run `tsc --module commonjs --out tmp src/models/maps/patient.ts`, `tmp` becomes a concatenation of files that I have referenced from `patient.ts`.\r\n\r\nHowever, `patient.ts` is compiled to `src/models/maps/patient.js`.\r\n\r\nThis seems like its broken.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.9.1.1",

      "Message": "Sounds like only patient.ts has top level imports & exports, and is thus compiled as a CommonJS module, whereas the others don't, and are just being compiled as global scripts.\n\nOnly global scripts support concatenation, modules don't.  Module source files to output files are one-to-one.  We have no option to compile multiple source files into one output module at this point.\n\nThe discussion at https://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/457222 goes over some of these topics.  We are aware it is a popular request, pain-point, and source of confusion.  We're trying to find ways to make this easier.",
