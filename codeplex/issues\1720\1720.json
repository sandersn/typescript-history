I'm also seeing this issue with HTMLElement in a recent lib.d.ts.\n\nAlso, this issue is from the currently unreleased develop branch (just pulled).  It's been reproducing for a few days now but it took me a while to track it down since the current version of Node.js doesn't have good reporting for stack overflows (but the current beta release does so that is how I eventually tracked it down).",
