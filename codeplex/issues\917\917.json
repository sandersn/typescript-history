    "Description": "Make class declarations open ended. \r\n\r\ne.g. the following should be valid\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ndeclare class Foo  {\r\n    static bar: any;\r\n    bas():any;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Amend Foo\r\ndeclare class Foo  {\r\n    static anotherStatic: any;\r\n    anotherMember():any;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#Workaround for Static properties\r\n\r\n*Warning : not flexible, for demo only*. Use the fact that modules are merged with classes in the type declaration space e.g.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ndeclare class Foo  {\r\n    static bar: any;\r\n    bas():any;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Amend Foo\r\ndeclare module Foo  {\r\n    export var anotherStatic: any;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n#Workaround for Member properties\r\nUnfortunately this requires *rewriting* the original definition: \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ndeclare var Foo : FooStatic;\r\ninterface FooStatic { // Static properties\r\n\tnew (): Foo;\r\n    bar: any;\r\n}\r\ninterface Foo{ // Instance properties\r\n\tbas():any;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Amend Foo \r\ninterface FooStatic  {\r\n   anotherStatic: any;\r\n}\r\ninterface Foo{\r\n\tanotherMember():any;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis means the user needs to create three things (`var, static interface, instance interface`) and is extremely intuitive to the new (average) TypeScript user (people that don't make definitions).",

      "Message": "It would be interesting to know if there is any theoretical or practical reason why Classes are not open ended? This is quite a show stopper for us used to code in vanilla javascript, where extending existing classes is many times really useful and a powerful feature that javascript provides but other languages are lacking...
