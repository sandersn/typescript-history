    "Description": "Hi guys,\r\nI'm using the languageservice to perform some analysis and I noticed that the isWriteAccess property on a reference entry seems to be wrong sometimes (I think). Or the property means something different than I'm expecting :)\r\n\r\nFor example when having:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar test = 4;\r\n```\r\nlanguageService.getReferencesAtPosition(\"test.ts\", 4) returns an array with one item where isWriteAccess is true (correct).\r\n\r\nNext example:\r\n```\r\npublic class  Test {\r\n    private usedParam: number;\r\n\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        this.usedParam = 4;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWith the above code, I get two items both with isWriteAccess false, I think it should be true in this case.\r\n(languageService.getReferencesAtPosition(\"test.ts\", 34))\r\n\r\nSo my question is, is isWriteAccess = false the right value in my second example?\r\n\r\nHope you guys can answer my question!\r\n \r\nedit: I'm using the typescript 0.9.5 branch",
