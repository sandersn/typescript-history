    "Description": "Visual Studio specific issues are polluting 'real' issues linked to the language semantics and the transpiler.\r\n\r\nCould you please separate issues in at least 3 sections:\r\n\r\n1. language\r\n1. transpiler\r\n1. Visual Studio\r\n\r\nLike many, we do not use Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be interesting to use a full fledged issue tracker so that we can monitor progress on resolution and comment/test as things are moving along",
