    "Description": "I noticed a small issue with a regex and I'm trying to build the PR for it, but I'm stumbling on fixing *every* place the regex appears in source.  In particular, the wholecompiler.ts and quotedCompiler.ts files (yes, only one has a capital letter).\r\n\r\nI've found a few issues with these files and their tooling:\r\n\r\n1. Changes to quotedCompiler.ts makes codeplex diffs slow, since it's the entire compiler in one quoted-string line.\r\n2. wholecompiler.ts is generated with a .bat file, it would be trivial to do this in .js\r\n3. The fileList.txt of sources to include into these files is written with backslash paths, so even though compilerToString.js (which produces the quotedCompiler.ts file) doesn't work on mac.\r\n4. The fileList.txt is out of date (it currently references ```..\\..\\..\\src\\compiler\\core\\hashTable.ts``` which is not present).\r\n\r\nSince these files are, in theory, generated, would it not make some sense to make that practice and remove them from git?",
