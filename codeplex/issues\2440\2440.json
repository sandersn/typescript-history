    "Description": "Hi, \r\n\r\ntwo guys in my team has a windows server 2008 R2 with IE9 installed and no IE10.\r\n\r\nthey installed typescript 1.0, and when building the solution (even command line), they get an exception saying\r\n\"api-ms-win-downlevel-advapi32-l1-1-0.dll is missing from your computer\".\r\n\r\nwe found a workaround by directly invoking tsc.js through node, but it requires from them to install nodejs, which is quite weird...",
