      "Message": "Yeah, this is an unfortunate problem at the moment that we're not going to be able to fix for 1.0. The TypeScript debugger is not able to track the context you're in as far as going in and out of arrow functions so that's why you see the wrong 'this' value sometimes when you're inside one. This is something we hope to fix in the future but requires a bit of work so it won't get done in the near term. I think we already have a bug on this but can't find it with a quick search so I'll leave this open as a suggestion to ensure it doesn't get lost, though the problem is definitely well known.",
