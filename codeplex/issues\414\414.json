    "Description": "Actually the issue was following:\n\ni have already generated a js file from ts with --sourcemap.\n\nNow in a post build event i was trying to generate a declaration file. The compiler saves a new js file and a d.ts. I did not specify -- sourcemap in the post build event.\n\nI was wrongly assuming that when --declaration is specified, ONLY the declaration d.ts is generated.\n\n ",
