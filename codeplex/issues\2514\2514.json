      "Message": "*grumble grumble* BTW, could someone make develop the default contribution target in codeplex?   because if I try to start a PR it automatically attempts to generate a diff of develop+fix onto **master**, and then codeplex hangs because that's a really big PR.\n\nThe workaround is to start the PR as personal/master -> typescript/master, update typescript first to develop, and then personal to the PR branch, but it's a lot of juggling just to prevent codeplex from shooting itself in the foot.\n\n\nAnyway, PR ready: https://typescript.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/AdamFreidin/typescript/contribution/6842",
