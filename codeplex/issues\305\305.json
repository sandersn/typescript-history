    "Description": "I'd like a new keyword (\"include\" would work) that would merge all top-level exported symbols from a module file into the scope where the include keyword appears.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n    module MyNamespace\r\n    {\r\n        include \"file1\"\r\n        include \"file2\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\nassuming file1.ts exports a class `MyClass1` and file2.ts exports a class `MyClass2`, the code would now have access to `MyNamespace.MyClass1` and `MyNamespace.MyClass2` including static type information.\r\n\r\nPermitting symbols to be included into the global namespace would be excellent, too, so that .ts files that export a module specify which 'namespace' the classes they contain reside.\r\n\r\nFor developers that prefer a class-per-file methodology, this feature would be extremely useful for simplifying code and reducing redundancy compared to using import alone.",
