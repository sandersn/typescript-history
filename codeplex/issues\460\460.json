      "Message": "We're currently working on a spec proposal for a more flexible feature that would allow you to \"mix\" abstractions together.  Where as currently you can mix two interfaces of the same now to create a new interface, we're looking into allowing an example like the following:\n\n```TypeScript\nclass Store { }\nmodule Store {\n  class Error { }\n}\n```\nThe resulting 'Store' could be instantiated like a class, but could also be used in a namespacing position, allowing you to say \"var x: Store.Error\"\n",

I'm going to close this issue so we can track against that one.\n\nAlso, my previous example should export the class to get the intended effect:\n\n```TypeScript\nclass Store { }\nmodule Store {\n  export class Error { }\n}\n```",
