Is there any way I can still get these errors while doing a batch compile? I am willing to call the tsc.js or typescriptServices.js directly if needed.\r<br />\n<br />\nIn other words, I am looking for a way where the compiler respects the file scope when type-checking, even if I am batch-compiling all the files together. I am right now investigating the PullTypeResolver class et al, since I am willing to even have a fork of the compiler if I can gain this feature, but I am wondering if isn't there an easier way to do it (or if perhaps I am missing something obvious).\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",
