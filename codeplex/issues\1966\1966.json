    "Description": "Well, title says it all. After installing the latest TS for both VS2012 and 2013, Intellisense in VS 2012 just, well, \"dies\".\r\n\r\nThis short [YouTube video shows the issue](http://youtu.be/08Vj1sB5Wnc) (sorry, tried attaching, but its slightly bigger than the file limit).\r\n\r\nHopefully this gets fixed - a big fan of TS, and understand it's not even v1 RTP...but still, it's getting to the point where dealing with issues gets in the way of, well, getting stuff done....\r\n\r\nKeep up the great work!",

We need you (Web Essentials) :)\n",

This occurs on VS 2012 and VS 2013. The only \"fix\" I've been able to do is:\n  * Show all files ->\n  * Include the hidden js file in the project. If I do this, the Publish(ed) app is \"complete\" and functional.\n\n* _does the intellisense failure happen in a new project?_\n  __Yes__, but this is _only for VS 2012_. Intellisense works perfectly fine on VS 2013. So it seems it's a \"side x side\" issue (both VS 2012 and 2013 are installed)",
