    "Description": "I'm not sure if this is a WebStorm or a TypeScript issue as the code will compile fine despite this issue, but I thought you guys might have some insight into why this issue might occur. \r\n\r\nI've noticed that when importing lodash after already referencing the definition file, WebStorm loses all the code intelligence it gains when referencing this definition file.\r\n\r\nThe code looks something like\r\n\r\n    /// <reference path=\"lodash.d.ts\" />\r\n    import _ = require('lodash');\r\n\r\nv.s.\r\n\r\n    /// <reference path=\"lodash.d.ts\" />\r\n\r\nBoth examples will compile just fine, so it does not affect the compiler.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I'm using the [DefinitelyTyped Lodash definition file](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/lodash/lodash.d.ts). \r\n\r\nSome screenshots that demonstrate what I mean:\r\n\r\n![Example without import](http://c.nath.is/V97W/Screen%20Shot%202014-04-23%20at%2011.32.05.png)\r\n\r\n![Example with import](http://c.nath.is/V9OI/Screen%20Shot%202014-04-23%20at%2011.32.png)\r\n\r\nI'm using the AMD module option. This is my File Watcher. \r\n\r\n![File Watcher](http://c.nath.is/V8rW/Image%202014-04-23%20at%2011.50.41%20am.png)\r\n\r\nAlso, the module is definitely installed in my node_modules folder. \r\n\r\n",
