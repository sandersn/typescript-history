    "Description": "We have code like this (selectedElementInfoPanelViewTests.ts):\r\n```\r\nimport SelectedElementInfoPanelView = require(\"chart/components/selectedElementInfoPanelView\");\r\n\r\nclass TestInfoPanelView extends SelectedElementInfoPanelView<ITestSelectedElement> {\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe parent class is defined like this (selectedElementInfoPanelView.ts):\r\n```\r\nclass SelectedElementInfoPanelView<T> extends Backbone.View {\r\n...\r\n}\r\nexport = SelectedElementInfoPanelView;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when it is emitted to JavaScript by the develop compiler the class is not present and there is an error when attempting to load the module.  This does not happen with the 0.9.1.1 compiler.  We've seen the compiler omit modules loaded via 'require' in the past when they were unused.  It seems like that logic is a bit too aggressive in this case and is considering 'SelectedElementInfoPanelView' to be unused.",
