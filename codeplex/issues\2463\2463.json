    "Description": "When inside a definition file (eg jquery.d.ts) and hovering over an interface member which has been JSDoc'd then intellisense is presented to the user in Visual Studio.  \r\n\r\nHowever, when in a different file which is making use of those definitions the same rich interface intellisense is *not* presented.  Just the type and name - none of the JSDoc stuff flows through.\r\n\r\nIt would be good if it was.\r\n\r\nWill attach images to demonstrate issue.",

Definitely worth doing at some point, marked as a suggestion for others to upvote appropriately.",
