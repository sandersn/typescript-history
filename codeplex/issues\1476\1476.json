Nothing else is accessing the js file it's trying to output. I have other files in the project structurally identical to this that compile just fine.\n\nMy workaround (for now) was to rename the file. It compiles OK then.\n\n",

On my build server I get the error referenced in this bug.\n\nthe build is directed to generate a file with no output directory defined, just a file to emit in the root folder of the project.  The msbuild project emits the following (abbreviated) command line:\n\ntsc.exe  --removeComments --out \"application.js\" --sourcemap --target ES5  C:\\Builds\\1\\ProjectName\\_references.ts\" ... // remaining .ts files here\n\nThanks for any help here.",
