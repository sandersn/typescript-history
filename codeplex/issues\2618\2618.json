    "Description": "Emacscript 5 already specifies that after calling Object.freeze, the returned object could not be modified. Would be a killer feature to allow that check at compile time. That would enable us to create functional data structures, i.e. immutable objects.\r\n\r\nThe following snippet should have failed to compile:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  var person = {\"age\": 29};\r\n  var newPerson = Object.freeze(person);\r\n  newPerson.age = 45;\r\n\r\n```",

      "Message": "Hey James, yes, they are related.\n\nHowever, it was commented on a forum thread that the team is focused on bringing the features that are part of the standard. while I favour very much the other suggestions, e.g. final classes and const for values, Object.freeze is already part of the standard.\n\n>> Would the result type of newPerson would be something like Frozen<{age: number}>?\n\nHi Sascha,\n\nYeah, good point. I suppose that Frozen<{age: number}> would need to be a proxy for {age: number} with readonly properties, which has already been asked for support :/ https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/352",
