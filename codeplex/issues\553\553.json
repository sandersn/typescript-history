If you say your function has a return type, but never actually return anything, it's very likely you simply forgot.\n\nFeel free to start a thread in the forums on this to see if there's a wider user consensus - we are not using the issue tracker to track things where the code matches the spec and the spec isn't obviously wrong.",

      "Message": "I am reopening this issue because the following code gives the following error:\n'Function declared a non-void return type, but has no return expression':\n\nclass A {\n\tgetStr(): string {\n\t}\n}\n\nIMHO, the compiler is correct to give an error in this case and it should give at least a warning in the original code snippet I posted. I understand the design decision to make undefined a valid value for a string type, and I think that is correct, but in that case, the 'return undefined' should be something explicitly written by a programmer:\n\nclass A {\n\tgetStr(): string {\n\t\tif (false) {\n\t\t\treturn 'hello';\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn undefined;\n\t}\n}\n\nI think most programmers really do not want the first snippet to type-check.\n\nMoreover, the TS compiler is handling 'no-statement' or whitespace as 'return undefined' in some cases and as 'no-statement' in some other cases.\n\nThank you!",
