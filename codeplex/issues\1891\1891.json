    "Description": "I use the \"no generated .js files in source control\" workflow.\r\nWhen using the visual studio Publish method, the js files are copied, but on the build server they don't (they get compiled in the Sources folder but not copied after).\r\n\r\nLooking at the log, I see the CompileTypeScript step is OK, but in the _CopyWebApplicationLegacy step, it's missing the generated .js files.\r\n\r\nAny idea how to solve that?\r\n(I already tried the <Target Name=\"TypeScriptCollectPublishFiles\" DependsOnTargets=\"CompileTypeScript\">modification suggested for azure deployment).\r\n\r\nthanks in advance",

So, I coped the contents of the MSBuild/Microsoft folder form my machine to the build server. Then after still having .target missing issues, I copied v12.0/TypeScript into v11.0/TypeScript and that seemed to have made the build work. \n\nHowever, the .js files are not being generated and copied to _PublishedWebsites like I would expect.",
