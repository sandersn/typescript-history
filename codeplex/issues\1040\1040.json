We have also fixed an occurrence of this in our latest develop branch.\n\nIf you still see issues with the latest bits, then if removing the definition file you reference helped, you should be able to narrow it down by eliminating parts of that.  If that doesn't help, attach a full project that reproduces the issue and we'll take a look.\n\nThanks!",
