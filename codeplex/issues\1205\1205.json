    "Description": "Our TypeScript project requires a custom Microsoft.TypeScript.targets file to integrate with our existing build system. This project has a single TypeScriptCompile entry, with all other source files included as Content. This file contains reference entries for all files in our project, allowing us to specify the order in which modules/classes should appear inside a single js output file (for proper dependency resolution).\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to the 0.9.0 release, whenever an error is encountered in a source file, Visual Studio will output duplicate entries in the Error List window. These errors only differ in the \"project\" from which they originate: there is one for the actual csproj file, but also a duplicate entry for the .ts file where the error was encountered.\r\n\r\nDouble clicking on the error coming from the .csproj file results in a second tab being opened. Visual Studio seems to think this is coming from a different project, and opening any of these files causes intellisense to be stuck at \"(refreshing...)\" and brings the whole IDE to a crawl. Further, closing these files often results in the following message being output to ActivityLog.xml (this is similar to issue 990):\r\n\r\n____System.ArgumentException: Value \"X:/redacted/path/sourceFile.ts\" is invalid for the 'fileName' parameter: the value must should not contain '/' characters Parameter name: X:/redacted/path/sourceFile.ts at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.FileNameScriptId..ctor(String fileName) at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.FileNameScriptId.CreateFileScriptId(String fileName) at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.KnownBuffersCollection.CollectBuffersFromRunningDocumentTable() at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.KnownBuffersCollection.get_Buffers() at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.DefaultScriptContextProvider.RefreshOpenDocumentList(Action callback, Nullable`1 delay) at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.DefaultScriptContextProvider.OnTextViewClosed(ITextView textView) at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.VsTextViewCreationListener.<>c__DisplayClass2.<VsTextViewCreated>b__1(Object sender, EventArgs e) at Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Utilities.GuardedOperations.RaiseEvent(Object sender, EventHandler eventHandlers)__\r\n__\r\n\r\nSomehow, the correct error entries seem to be the ones that refer to the .ts file as the \"project\", rather than the ones from the project itself...\r\n",
