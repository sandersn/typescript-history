    "Description": "I have another tool that needs to have ///<references/> in the output js files and those paths need to be to the js files not the ts files. What I would really like is for tsc.exe to convert and preserve references in the output js for non .d.ts file references. An optional flag for this would be just fine, or when using \"-c\" would be fine too. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n/one.ts\r\n/two.ts\r\n/// <reference path=\"one.ts\" />\r\n/// <reference path=\"common.d.ts\" />\r\n\r\nShould be compiled into:\r\n/one.js\r\n/two.js\r\n/// <reference path=\"one.js\" />",
