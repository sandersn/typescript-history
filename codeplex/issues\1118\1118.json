    "Description": "I tried to test new beta release of Typescript 0.9\r\nI tried to convert my project available at https://github.com/BBGONE/jRIAppTS\r\nto use generics in collection.ts and db.ts modules. (I attached the project to the issue)\r\nThere were some issues when i tryed to do this, but the most critical\r\nis that the compiler crashes with internal error : Unable to get value of the property 'getType': object is null or undefined\r\n\r\nThe other issues are of types incompatability (although they are compatable)\r\nFor example in the collection.ts module \r\nthere's type declaration \r\n\r\n```\r\n  export class Collection<TItem extends CollectionItem> extends RIAPP.BaseObject \r\n```\r\nthis type includes field\r\n```\r\n _items: TItem[];\r\n```\r\nin the constructor there's a line\r\n```\r\nthis._items = <any>[];\r\n```\r\nIf you remove <any> casting the VS2012 designer shows error\r\nCan not convert TItem[][] to TItem[]\r\n",

      "Message": "What you are talking about is already attached to the issue.\nIt is a project, just use compile.bat to compile the project to jriapp.js.\nThe same you can do to open the attached project in VS2012 and try to compile it.\nThe compiler will crash. Is it not enougth for the repro?\nHow i can figure out what causes it if the compiler does not give an explanation what causes it in the code.\nCan you debug the compiler and see what is the problem in this particular situation?\nIs it normal behaviour for the compiler to crash on code compilation without giving any hint what had caused it?",
