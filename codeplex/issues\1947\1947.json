    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\n__Version 9.5 Beta__\r\n\r\nThe following fails to compile, but saving the file generates an \"Output(s) generated successfully\" message on the status bar.\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nvar x = new foobar();\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould this not generate an error message? or are there some assumptions being made about `foobar` existing in another file?\r\n\r\nIf that is the case then I feel the usefulness of the status bar message is somewhat reduced. It should be exactly equal to the build result.",

      "Message": "If you check on disk, you should observe that the resulting .js file was indeed generated correctly.\n\nThe above code would only generate a type error, as it cannot locate a declaration for \"foobar\".  However in TypeScript, issues with types are really more 'warnings', as the type system evaporates at compile time anyway.  Unless you have a syntax error, the JavaScript should still be generated.\n\nWe do realize we have work to do here to make this more useful (i.e. differentiate between warnings and errors, then allow compile switches such as \"treat warnings as errors\", etc...).  This is on our backlog for a future release.\n\nThanks.",
