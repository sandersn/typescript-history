We'd like to keep with our philosophy of keeping a very light codegen, so we've been talking about ways we could incorporate his safety checks as an opt-in level of safety/strictness.  This would work similarly to how &quot;no implicit any&quot; works now.\r<br />\n<br />\nStill very early on, but so far it's sounding promising.<br />\n",

Also copying my comment from there:<br />\n<blockquote>\nI tried running a diff with 0.9.5 and the majority of changes seem to be under <code>src\\compiler\\typecheck\\sound\\</code> and <code>src\\compiler\\typecheck\\tsStar.ts</code>. It's a bit hard to get a proper diff because a bunch of files just had their line endings changed.<br />\n</blockquote>\n",
