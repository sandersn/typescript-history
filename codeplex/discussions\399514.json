But I found a easier way to build my own one, and built the first version of VEJIS years ago.</p>\r\n<p>Now VEJIS comes to version 0.5, with powerful Visual Studio 2012 and VEJIS's intellisense file, VEJIS can provide a great typed programming experience.</p>\r\n<p>VEJIS provides &quot;grammar-like level&quot; enhancing for methods, classes, etc. E.g. method overloading, class inheriting. And also features like interfaces and modules.</p>\r\n<p>It's just a home brew now, but if you are interested in it, please visit <a href=\"http://vejis.org\">\r\nvejis.org</a>.</p>\r\n",
