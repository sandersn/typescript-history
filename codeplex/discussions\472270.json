    "Html": "this._gl.viewport is a function, it doesn't have a width or height property to assign to which is exactly what the error message is saying. The old version of this code worked because it was written as an index operation:\r<br />\n<br />\nthis._gl.viewport['width'] = width;\r<br />\n<br />\nwhich returns an 'any' that can then be assigned anything. Your viewport function now has a width property in the underlying JavaScript but not in the TypeScript type system. It's possible to use a merged declaration to represent the viewport function as a function with a width property but my guess is this code just wasn't correct before either.<br />\n",
