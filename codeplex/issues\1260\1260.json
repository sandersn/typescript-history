    "Description": "The following typescript program is accepted:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass C {\r\n\tstatic length ()  { return \"twelve\"; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in the generated code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar C = (function () {\r\n    function C() {\r\n    }\r\n    C.length = function () {\r\n        return \"twelve\";\r\n    };\r\n    return C;\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, an attempt is made to assign to the `length` property of a function. This doesn't work (at least in Firefox and Chrome), causing subsequent calls of `C.length()` to crash. Perhaps calling a static class function `length` should just be disallowed?",
