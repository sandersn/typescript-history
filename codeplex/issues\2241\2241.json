    "Description": "\"TypeScript offers classes, modules, and interfaces to help you build robust components\".\r\n\r\nA nice feature to make components even more robust would be to run simple user-defined tests against them.\r\n\r\nWhat i have in mind is similar to the \"interface\" notion. Code that is only used during development/compilation, but never makes it to the javascript file\r\n\r\nA sample could look something like this\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\ninterface Person {\r\n    name:string,\r\n    age:number\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Student {\r\n    public name: string;\r\n    public age: number;\r\n    constructor(name: string, age: number) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n        this.age = age;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public sayHelloTo = function (addr: Person) {\r\n        return \"Hello \" + addr.name + \", I'm \" + this.name + \".\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public haveBirthday = function () {\r\n        this.age++;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest Student ('John', 21) {\r\n    this.sayHelloTo(new Student('Max', 19)):equals(\"Hello Max, I'm John.\"),\r\n    this.sayHelloTo(new Student('Dave', 22)):indexOf('Dave',6),\r\n    this.haveBirthday():equals(this.age, 22),\r\n    this.haveBirthday():gt(this.age, 21)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should not be a replacement for the super sophisticated test runners out there, but give the developer the ability to make some simple value checks as a addon to the typechecking capabilities of typescript.\r\n\r\nThis would lead to:\r\n\"TypeScript offers classes, modules, interfaces and __tests__ to help you build __super__ robust components\".",
