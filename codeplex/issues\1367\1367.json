    "Description": "Please consider adding support for object literal property value shorthand, as per the ES6 proposal: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:object_literals#object_literal_property_value_shorthand. This would allow for the following:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction foo(a: number) {\r\n  var b = 123;\r\n  return { a, b };  // instead of { a: a, b: b };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems like a very simple change to the current parser, would save a lot of unnecessary typing, is in-line with the support already added for object literal property shorthands for functions and getters/setters, and would be forward-leaning towards possible eventual support for object destructuring.",
