    "Description": "TSC fails with a strange error when it tries to compile an ISO-8859-1 file with non-english characters.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n\"áááááá\";\r\n// error TS5004: Could not find file: 'file.ts'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has been happening to me because the default TypeScript file that VS2012 creates is ANSI, and it won't change the file automatically to UTF-8 if you add non-english characters, you need to do it manually. Once the file has been converted to Unicode, the error goes away.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that TSC should give a more meaningful error like \"Files with non-english chars must be encoded in unicode before compilation\". or something like that instead of \"could not find the file.\"",
