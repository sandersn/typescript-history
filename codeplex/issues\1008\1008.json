    "Description": "The compiler accepts this code with no warnings.\r\nClearly it could be helpful if it warned that ```thing``` was multiply defined.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass X {\r\n   thing: number = 0;\r\n   constructor(public thing: number) {\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, ```new X(42).thing``` is 0, not 42.\r\n",
