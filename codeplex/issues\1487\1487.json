    "Description": "For example, suppose we have the following two files:\r\n\r\nnumber.ts\r\n```\r\nvar x = 5;\r\n```\r\n\r\nstring.ts\r\n```\r\nvar x = 'hi';\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 0.9.0, `tsc number.ts string.ts` would have give the following error: `string.ts(1,5): error TS2000: Duplicate identifier 'x'.`\r\n\r\nIn 0.9.1, however, it compiles fine. This alone seems wrong. However, `x` also keeps the type of the first declaration. So, if we have:\r\n\r\nfunction.ts\r\n```\r\nvar square = (x: number) => x*x;\r\nsquare(x);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`tsc number.ts string.ts function.ts` compiles fine but `tsc string.ts number.ts function.ts` gives: \r\n```\r\nfunction.ts(2,1): error TS2081: Supplied parameters do not match any signature of call target.\r\nfunction.ts(2,1): error TS2087: Could not select overload for 'call' expression.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we assume that compilation order corresponds to load order for a project (which seems a reasonable choice for projects), this is opposite to what make sense for runtime types.",
