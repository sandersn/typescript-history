    "Description": "Within the language service API, the ErrorEntry contains a message (string), but not an identifier or severity. It would be nice to be able to inform the user of the severity of an error.\n\nAt least there should be a difference between a parse error (so no JS file can be generated) and just a type check error (and a JS file could still be generated if required to do so).\n\n",
