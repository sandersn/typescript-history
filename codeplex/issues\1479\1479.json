    "Description": "The compiler allows returning undefined or null on functions with explicit return types. This should not be allowed as it is clearly a bug in the user's code and is simple to check for.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction foo(): number {\r\n  // Why is this allowed?\r\n  return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction bar(): number {\r\n  // Why is this allowed?\r\n  return null;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Foo {\r\n  foo(): Foo {\r\n    return null;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Bar extends Foo {\r\n  foo() {\r\n    // Why is this allowed?\r\n    return;\r\n\r\n    // This allows Bar to extend Foo even though it is never reached. The error\r\n    // for the above return statement is only detected if this return statement\r\n    // is removed.\r\n    return new Foo();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
