    "Description": "Support constants defined with the \"const\" keyword, and inline these constants when compiling to JS. Many JS engines already have support for this, and treat it like a var.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// colors for linux \r\nconst red   \t= '\\033[31m';\r\nconst green   \t= '\\033[32m';\r\nconst yellow   \t= '\\033[33m';\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen publishing in __release__ mode, the typescript compiler should inline these replacing the const with the value, and delete the const definitions.\r\n\r\nIn __debug__ mode, const declarations should be outputted with the var keyword.",
