But I've also noticed that the number of daily checkins has dropped dramatically. In fact, the only checkins in the last 10 days have all come from one person, and they're just tuning the lib.d.ts file(s).<br />\n<br />\nThat decrease in pace is fine - we're approaching a real release, after all - but I just wanted to check in and make sure that MS wasn't going to pull another Silverlight on us and either drop or severely minimize its support for ongoing TS development. TS is a great language, but I got burned badly by the Silverlight fiasco (I had to throw away three years of development on a consumer-facing app when it became clear that Silverlight penetration was never going to get above 60%), and I don't want to get stuck again in a dead-end technology. <br />\n<br />\nI presume - hope - pray? - that nothing like that is going on. But a word from some of the folks on the inside would be helpful, too.<br />\n",
