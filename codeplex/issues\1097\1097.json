    "Description": "If module A imports module B and module B imports module A, and the compiler is invoked from within Visual Studio by the Web Essentials package, the compiler hangs up.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n* this works fine from the command line.\r\n* the compiler does not use any CPU at this point, so it is not an \"infinite cycle\".\r\n* observed in AMD mode; did not try in CommonJS.\r\n* since circular references will not actually work anyway, this is not a problem in itself, but I'm still reporting it here, because it could point to some bigger problem within the compiler; also, a meaningful error message would be nice. :-)",
