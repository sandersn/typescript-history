    "Description": "I'm using Typescript with the \"--out\" option.   This concatenates all my generated JS files into a single file taking dependencies into account.  However, I have to concatenate my external Javascript libraries, like JQuery, as an additional step to get them into the monolithic file.\r\n\r\nI want to extend \"reference\" to support Javascript files.  If \"--out\" is specified, references would be tracked as dependencies and would get copied \"as-is\" into the monolithic Javascript file.  If \"--out\" wasn't specified, they would be ignored.\r\n\r\n/// <reference path='jquery.js'/>\r\n",
