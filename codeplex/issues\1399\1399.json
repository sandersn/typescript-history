    "Description": "https://gist.github.com/DavidBruant/6094995\r\n\r\nI'd like to write the code in the client.ts file. Currently, I have to write what's in graph-ts-0.9.d.ts including adding some useless internal interfaces. This is due to the fact that the only constraint that can be put on generic types is \"extends\" which is a strict extends (doesn't includes the base class), while what I would need is a \"is-a\" constraint. \r\n\r\nThe graph-hoped-ts.d.ts describes what I wish to author. The \"is-a\" keyword can obviously be replaced by anything else of your preference. I can more about the flexibility of the constraint than specific keywords :-)",
