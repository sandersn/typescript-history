    "Description": "After upgrade I am getting VS2012 messages everywhere saying:  \n\nThe name 'xxx' does not exist in the current scope. Here below for example I get the message: \"The name 'window' does not appear in the current scope:\n\nmodule Layout {\n    export class BodyControls {\n        addWindowEvents() {\n            $(window)\n\nHope someone can help. My project has come to a stop. FYI I'm using the latest version of web essentials and these messages appear in the .ts window of VS2012.",
