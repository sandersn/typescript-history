    "Description": "I created a class with 25-30 properties of type KnockoutObservable<T> whose definition resided in a different file.\r\n\r\nThis file failed to complete compiling, the output from web essentials gave the following line\r\n30/07/2013 14:15:20: Compiling TypeScript...\r\n\r\nbut would not get as far as compiling the actual file and I would not receive the following output\r\n30/07/2013 14:15:23: TypeScript: Compiling cm.models.client.js\r\n\r\nAfter stripping the class back to basics it would compile properly again.  After adding the first property back in....\r\n```\r\nexport class ClientKo {\r\n        Id: KnockoutObservable<number>;\r\n        constructor(client: IClient) {\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI got the error message...\r\nCompile Error. \r\nSee error list for details\r\n.../cm.models.client.ts(53,13): error TS2095: Could not find symbol 'KnockoutObservable'.\r\n\r\nSilly me I had forgotten to import the class containing the definition for KnockoutObservable.  \r\n\r\nAdd the the import declaration and it compiles, then added all the rest of the properties and logic back into the class and it compiles again.\r\n\r\nAnyway would be nice if I could add as many properties as I like and still get an error message.\r\n\r\nP.S.  Loving the typescript, keep up the good work :)",
