There are definitely compiler speed improvements we're intending to make before release but these ones appear to be largely related to how Web Essentials is behaving. If you can isolate any issues without Web Essentials feel free to re-open this issue, we'll be driving down compiler performance over time regardless.",

I see folks added more info, but if you don't also reopen, this is still a closed issue.  Please be sure to reopen also so it gets flagged in our queries.\r\n\r\nThanks for the update oisin.  Unfortunately we have seen some customers encounter some issues with Web Essentials & TypeScript.  This can spin up instances of the compiler for a number of reasons.  TypeScript itself only spins up tsc.exe from within MSBuild (i.e. when you build a project).  Other TypeScript activities (including TypeScript's 'Compile on Save', which is done by the language service in VS), don't spin up tsc.exe.  \r\n\r\nschungx, you mention you are seeing compiler instances just by typing.  Please check any installed extensions for something causing this behavior, as it is unlikely to be TypeScript itself.\r\n\r\nAs preliminary data, we have observed that tsc.exe instances can get created in Web Essentials with the following options & activities (Note: We are still actively investigating to confirm these, and providing early hypothesis to help with troubleshooting)\r\n\r\n1. Add generated files to project\r\n  - Causes tsc.exe to spawn when the solution is opened.\r\n2. Compile All TypeScript files on build\r\n  - Spawns a new instance of tsc.exe for each d.ts and .ts file (possibly from the UI thread, and waiting until completion).\r\n3. Compile TypeScript on save\r\n  - Spawns a new instance of tsc.exe to compile the file (and perhaps its references - which it appears can result in multiple instance). Note: The native TypeScript implementation uses a the TypeScript Language Service to regenerate just the file in question, so should be very fast, but it does use the same thread as intellisense uses to generate completion list data, so this could see a minor 'hiccup' on a large compile)\r\n4. Show preview window\r\n  - Requires the Web Essentials “Compile on Save” option to be enabled.  Se above.\r\n\r\nIf you have any of these settings enabled, please try disabling and see if you continue to see the same issues, and report back with findings.  Thanks.",

      "Message": "Bit more info:\n\n- Yes, I have Web Essentials on and \"Compile to Save\" turned on from Web Essentials\n\n- Confirmed that Web Essentials *does* spin up \"TypeScript Compiler\" (this is the description string in the task manager, I suppose it is tsc.exe) when saving\n\n- Saving again before the compiling is done will spin up *another* \"TypeScript Compiler\" instance.  There doesn't seem to be an upper limit.  So pressing Ctrl-S five times in a row will spin up five compiler instances.\n\n- In situations where tsc.exe runs out of stack space, the \"TypeScript Compiler\" instance continues to exist and consume CPU (typically all of one core).\n\n- In situations where tsc.exe stops with an error, the error text is reflected into the generated JavaScript -- this is the correct behavior.\n\n- In situations where tsc.exe faults (but not due to stack overrun), the \"TypeScript Compiler\" instance no longer exists.\n\n- When editing code, the editor will halt after a few characters (after a short idle interval) and does a complete syntax check.  I haven't observed tsc.exe being spun up during this check process so I am wrong in my previous comment.  Sorry!\n\n- The syntax checking is quite slow, and doing it after each keystroke makes editing code a pain.\n",
