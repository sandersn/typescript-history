    "Description": "This should work if rearrange into a function+module pattern, but we're giving an error.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nI'm getting an error in 0.9 for something that worked before.  Previously I had this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// dojo.d.ts\r\ndeclare module dojo.query.pseudos {\r\n    export function has(name: any, condition: any): any;\r\n    export function visible(name: any, condition: any): any;\r\n    export function hidden(name: any, condition: any): any;\r\n    export function selected(name: any, condition: any): any;\r\n    export function checked(name: any, condition: any): any;\r\n    export function disabled(name: any, condition: any): any;\r\n    export function enabled(name: any, condition: any): any;\r\n    export function input(name: any, condition: any): any;\r\n    export function button(name: any, condition: any): any;\r\n    export function header(name: any, condition: any): any;\r\n}\r\ndeclare module dojo {\r\n    export function query(refNode: Node): any;\r\n    export function query(query: string, refNode?: Node): any;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now it gives the error \"Duplicate identifier 'query.'\"\r\n\r\nIf I rearrange the order of the blocks so the function is declared first the declaration has no errors but every usage of query has the error \"Unable to invoke type with no call signatures.\"\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or should I be doing my declaration differently now?",
