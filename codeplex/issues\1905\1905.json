Can you post any details about what you had installed on the machine (VS 2012, VS 2013, previous versions of TypeScript, etc?) so we can try to reproduce it here? Thanks!",

Could not load file or assembly 'file:///C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v11.0\\TypeScript\\TypeScript.tasks.dll' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.

Just installed over the top of whatever I had installed prior.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n",
