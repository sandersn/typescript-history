    "Description": "Just spent the last hour trying to figure this out...\r\n\r\nThis morning I installed the 0.8.1 MSI on my wks and win server 2008 r2 dev servers without an issue.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon I pulled down the msi to my win server 2008 r2 VM - and it gave the error \"The package cannot be installed\". After much hair pulling I discovered the byte count of the file pulled down this afternoon is 4880892 wheras the size of the files this morning is 4939776. So its possible that there is a but msi out there?\r\n\r\nI tries pulling down again to a different machine and the bad fine came down.\r\n\r\nAny ideas.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDonal\r\n",
