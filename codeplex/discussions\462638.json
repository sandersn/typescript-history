Sorry I can't remember the exact paths, but I was a bit pressed to get the thing working. After this I deleted those folders, re-installed Typescript and voila, it was working again.\r<br />\n<br />\nOnce again sorry for the sketchy instructions, but hope it enough to help you guy.\r<br />\n<br />\nVC<br />\n",
