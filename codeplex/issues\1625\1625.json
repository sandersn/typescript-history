    "Description": "I have a TypeScript project and I've gone into the Tools > Options > TextEditor > TypeScript menu, and enabled \"Auto list members\".  When I do this, it works for the first file I code in. When I switch to another file, the auto listing stops working. If I open the tools window again, I see that the option is unchecked. If I check it, it works again...until I switch to another file, then it stops and is unchecked again in the dialog, etc.\r\n\r\nAttached is a solution that I'm seeing this behavior in.",
