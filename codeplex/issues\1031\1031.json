    "Description": "Steps:\r\n- checkout typescript project\r\n- run \"npm install\"\r\n- open src/compiler/ast.ts\r\n- change line #41 to \"public isExpression() { returnfalse; }\" to simulate an error\r\n- run \"jake\"\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nYou will not see the actual error, but a message like this: \r\n\r\nError: C:/GitDevelopment/typescript/src/compiler/ast.ts(41,32):\r\n    at api.fail (C:\\Users\\benjpas\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\jake\\lib\\api.js:221:18)\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\n- run tsc directly and the error output is complete.\r\n\r\nIssues found:\r\n- tsc calls process.exit after compile. jake spawns tsc and uses a pipe to read from stdout and stderr. pipes are non blocking and are known to loose output as soon as the process terminates and the output is not flushed.\r\n\r\n",
