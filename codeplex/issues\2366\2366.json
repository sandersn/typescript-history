    "Description": "Strict mode would fit really well with TypeScript's way of formalising JavaScript so maybe there should be optional compiler support.\r\n\r\nIt can raise some errors on any illegal sloppy mode source code.\r\n\r\nIt would also take care of emitting the `'use strict';` directive: 'commonjs' would have it op top of file after the ///references, while 'amd' might have it in the define function. \r\n\r\nCurrently we rely on some support in TSLint but I think there could be something gained at compiler level.
