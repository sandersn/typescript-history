    "Description": "The completion list is incorrectly showing pretty much everything and the kitchen sink. It seems like it's showing basically every word in the editor. Try this in the playground:\r\n\r\n``` TypeScript\r\nclass A {\r\n\tstatic foo: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar a = new A();\r\na. //Congratulations, EVERY word in this file is part of the completion list\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne item to note in particular is that static members are appearing in the completion list of instance variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
