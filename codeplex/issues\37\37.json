    "Description": "A TypeScript compiler written in TypeScript is nice. Even the language services are implemented in TypeScript! So to seal the whole deal of showing how powerful this new language is for developing web applications, make a cloud-based IDE that runs in the browser.\r\n\r\nLet's evolve beyond the current burdens of setting up development environments, making them operating system dependent, etc. TypeScript could be the tool to make that happen very nicely.",
