None the less, these steps should reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nOpen a command prompt and type in the following commands \r\n\r\ngit clone https://github.com/madmaw/iassetlab.git\r\ncd iassetlab\r\ngit reset --hard 369a58492cec3bfbc95a6c0feb8a8f2c9a5ff305\r\ncd iassetlab-templa\r\nant samples\r\n\r\nWork around the browser security for accessing local files as described here https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally (or just use IE and click the \"allow active x access\" popup)\r\n\r\nAccess iassetlab/iassetlab-templa/index.html in your favorite browser\r\n\r\nThere will be a script error that fairly obviously traces back to a missing _this variable.
