It also makes moving files around inside your application more difficult as you might have to update every reference in every file you move!<br />\n",

For example, if you do it for how import paths work, should we also output a config file for doing the loading, or do we leave that up to the user?\r<br />\n<br />\nI agree in theory that this would help.  It's just like adding an include path.  But I'd want to have a pretty clear understanding of just how far the feature goes (and doesn't go).<br />\n",
