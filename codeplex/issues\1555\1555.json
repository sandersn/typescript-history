The errors appears like you may not be.  (And perhaps 0.9.1 is working if it is already installed, and thus a no-op).\n\nIf that doesn't work, I'd run as sudo to fully uninstall typescript and then try installing again with the --force flag to ensure it is trying to refresh the package.  \n\nPlease reopen if this doesn't help.  Thanks!",

      "Message": "Hi Bill. Yes, I did run as root. Also tried installing to local dir (no -g), as root, same error message. Regardless if 0.9.1 was or was not installed, either globally or locally, trying to install 0.9.1-1 removes it and leaves no version installed. Installing 0.9.1 works fine globally and locally. I really try to resolve these things before posting, as I don't want to waste your guy's time working to make TS so f'ing awesome!!\r\nthx.",
