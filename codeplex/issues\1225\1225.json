I make changes to helloWorld.ts. After I run the project, the compiled files helloWorld.js, helloWorld.js.map, and helloWorld.min.js are added to the .csproj file. I try to remove the compiled JavaScript files by deleting them from the project. I then save-all. The .csproj file does not include those JavaScript files anymore. If I make more changes to helloWorld.ts and run again, then the compiled JavaScript files are re-added to the project again.",

      "Message": "Can you expand further on your issue here.  I'm not following 100% from the steps outlined.  Did you start with a project with the typescript & JavaScript, remove the JavaScript manually from the .csproj, and are seeing these files get readded in the .csproj file on compilation?\n\nYou also mention 'sometimes'.  Is this not consistent?  Roughly how frequently does this happen?  Are there any specifics steps that are performed when it does occur?\n\nAre you using any type of source control system?  Or is this just a file based project loaded off disk?  Which version of TypeScript are you using?  The project integration is not identical across all versions we have released.\n\nIf you can provide more specifics on your actions and observations we'll take a look.  Thanks.",
