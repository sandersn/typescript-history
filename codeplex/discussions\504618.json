There're certainly a slew of Visual Studio features that have been developed over the years that we'd like TypeScript to be able to (better) take advantage of. Picking the priority of each one and when to support it is obviously a balancing act so if people are upvoting specific ones more than others that's useful data for us.<br />\n",
