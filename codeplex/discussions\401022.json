Here's our code sample:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<pre>var modal = {\r\n    content: '',\r\n    form: '',\r\n    $form: '',\r\n    $message: '',\r\n    $modal: '',\r\n    $submits: '',\r\n    href: ''\r\n}\r\n\r\n$.modal = function (options) {\r\n    var settings = $.extend({}, $.modal.defaults, options),\r\n        root = getModalDiv(),\r\n    function getModalDiv() {\r\n        var modal = $('#modal');\r\n        return modal;\r\n    };\r\n})(jQuery);\r\n\r\nmodal.$modal = $.modal({\r\n    title: link.title,\r\n    closeButton: true,\r\n    content: modal.content,\r\n    onClose: onModalClose,\r\n    minWidth: 315,\r\n    maxHeight: false,\r\n    width: false,\r\n    resizeOnLoad: true\r\n});\r\nmodal.$form = modal.$modal.find('.form');</pre>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The problem here is we are not sure how to define $modal. Right now it's defined as a string which I know is not correct. As a result there's an error when the .find method is run against it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How can we correctly define $modal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also the reason we are using the modal variable is that this is populated and used by the inner functions in our code. Is this still the best way to do this now we have started to use typescript or is there a better way to create an object that we can pass\r\n around?</p>\r\n",
