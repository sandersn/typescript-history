    "Description": "In the current lib.d.ts HTML...Element definitions make these elements newable. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeclare var HTMLDivElement: {\r\n    prototype: HTMLDivElement;\r\n    new (): HTMLDivElement;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt compile time the following line does not error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar myDiv = new HTMLDivElement();\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it should as this will fail at runtime.\r\n\r\nI think the correct definition should be:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeclare var HTMLDivElement: {\r\n    prototype: HTMLDivElement;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would give the compile time error \"invalid new expression\", which I think is true in this case.",
