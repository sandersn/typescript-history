    "Description": "When I try to invoke `tsc` from java program, I met this problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14534511/java-cant-get-full-error-when-running-an-external-command\r\n\r\nI thought it was something wrong with my java code, but I found the same problem when using \"grunt-typescript\", see the error message, only has the first line of whole error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nE:\\WORKSPACE\\WindBase>grunt.cmd\r\nRunning \"typescript:WindBase\" (typescript) task\r\n<WARN> E:/WORKSPACE/WindBase/typescripts/directives/directives.ts(6,0):  Use --f\r\norce to continue. </WARN>\r\n\r\nAborted due to warnings.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wonder if `tsc` has something special that the full error message it produced can't be retrieved by external invoking?",

      "Message": "How are you invoking your command? I think that the problem is that your java application spawns a new process in a new thread. Java app completes executing before tsc and because of that you are unable to retrieve full data stream. I had the same issue with Node.js spawning a child tsc process.",
