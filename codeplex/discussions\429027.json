The T4 template file has a Custom Tool that will transform the template and write the result to an associated .cs file, that is part of the Project.\r\n So basically whenever you save the design file (.edmx in EF) it will alter the content of your source file accordingly. This does not happen at compile time.</p>\r\n",
