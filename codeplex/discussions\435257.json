    "Html": "I have just started investigating TypeScript and the performance of the editor is horrid!  It is so bad that I expected to see a flood of complaints but haven't been able to find any.  I'm using the default template in VS2012 with a single code file that is only 100 lines long.  The formatter (which I understand is written in TypeScript) takes an unacceptably long amount of time to indent and format code.  For example, hitting enter 4 times at the bottom of the file which changes nothing in the file results in the following status messages:\r<br />\n<br />\nSmart Indenting task took more than 1 second(s) to complete. Try again later.\r<br />\nFormatting task took more than 2 second(s) to complete. Try again later.\r<br />\nSmart Indenting task took more than 1 second(s) to complete.

I've tried the Microsoft fix of restarting and reinstalling with no luck.  I'm running a quad core i7-950, so I'm doubting it's that.\r<br />\n<br />\nAm I the only one with this problem?<br />\n",

I think this started occurring with 0.8.3 - never encountered it in previous versions.\r<br />\n<br />\nRestarting VS fixed it.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe second time round, I found that there were actually 3 devenv.exe processes (on task manager). Killing the two non-active processes has made things a bit more stable, in the sense it has not occurred since (about 12 hours).\r<br />\n<br />\nStrange problem. I'm not able to shed any more light on this at the moment, but I wonder if anyone else is having this issue?\r<br />\n<br />\nNoel<br />\n",
