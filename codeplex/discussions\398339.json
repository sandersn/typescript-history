Was just curious if the TypeScript compiler be adapted to allow safe use of Allman-style braces in&nbsp;<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://encosia.com/in-javascript-curly-brace-placement-matters-an-example/\">places where it classically\r\n breaks JavaScript code</a>? TypeScript is designed to generate idiomatic JavaScript, so the resulting braces would be generated in K&amp;R style anyhow.</p>\r\n<p>As an example:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:green\">// currently breaks in JS (and won't compile in TypeScript)</span>\r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">function</span> getPerson() {        \r\n    <span style=\"color:green\">// compiler inserts semicolon after return, return executes prematurely</span>\r\n    <span style=\"color:blue\">return</span> \r\n    {\r\n        firstname: <span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;Eric&quot;</span>,\r\n        lastname: <span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;Allman&quot;</span>\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n",

    "Html": "Please - don't do this. There are enough brace wars as it is.\r<br />\nTypeScript K&amp;R style reads the same as JavaScript, CSS, Dart, Go, Java, etc. K&amp;R is the one way we can all be consistent everywhere in our web stack.\r<br />\nWhy have TS developers get accustomed to a style that is incompatible with the web? :( Why can't we all be in harmony?\r<br />\nArguable, Ruby, Python, VB.NET, etc. read &quot;K&amp;R style&quot; because they have no analogy to the opening curly brace. Thus, just as in K&amp;R style with C-syntax, you are looking for a tab to start the block.\r<br />\n<br />\nI would like to argue K&amp;R is better and I am biased, but I am NOT doing that here.\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope to make the point that K&amp;R is <em>consistent</em> with the web. I would like to see TS have wider adoption, perhaps even beyond just MS-devs.<br />\n",
