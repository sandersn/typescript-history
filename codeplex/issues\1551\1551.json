    "Description": " This was an experiment I tried (playing around with tsc).\r\n\r\nUsing WebEssentials inside of Visual Studio (or the tsc command installed via NPM)\r\n\r\nRepro steps:\r\n\r\n- Download the jquery source (I used [http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.js](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.js)) into a `jquery.ts` file\r\n- Fix first compiler error by passing in \"undefined\" as the second parameter to the jquery wrapper function (last line - should be `(window, undefined)` instead of just `(window)`\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror TS2081: Supplied parameters do not match any signature of call target.\r\nerror TS2087: Could not select overload for 'call' expression.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n- After the above error is fixed I then get the following error.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n/*\r\n\r\nCompile Error. \r\nSee error list for details\r\n tsc.js(48810, 9) Microsoft JScript runtime error: Out of stack space\r\n\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand that the jQuery source may be a bit large, but I was hoping `tsc` could handle it.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
