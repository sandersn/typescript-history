    "Description": "I've been working on a small project for about a week and intellisense worked fine.\r\n\r\nSuddenly today in the midst of normal coding it stopped working, possibly after I started using the most recent jquery.d.ts in the project.\r\n\r\nNow whenever I start Visual Studio and load the project, the IDE is slow, intellisense doesn't work, and the IDE displays \"Refreshing...\" forever, see the attached screenshot.\r\n\r\nI've restarted VisualStudio several times and it hasn't helped.\r\n\r\nAny idea on how I can diagnose which change led to the problem?\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nAfter a while playing around I got a crash box that pointed me at ActivityLog.xml. The last entry is below. I had sinon-chai.d.ts open in an editor window and when I closed it the problem went away.\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to reproduce the issue by reopening sinon-chai.d.ts in VisualStdio\r\n\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <record>699</record>\r\n    <time>2013/10/07 21:32:36.931</time>\r\n    <type>Error</type>\r\n    <source>Editor or Editor Extension</source>\r\n    <description>System.ArgumentException: Value \"C:/David/apf/head10/issdev/src/javascript/RealView/scripts/node_modules/sinon-chai/lib/sinon-chai.d.ts\" is invalid for the 'fileName' parameter: the value must should not contain '/' characters\r\nParameter name: C:/David/apf/head10/issdev/src/javascript/RealView/scripts/node_modules/sinon-chai/lib/sinon-chai.d.ts\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.FileNameScriptId..ctor(String fileName)\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.FileNameScriptId.CreateFileScriptId(String fileName)\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.KnownBuffersCollection.CollectBuffersFromRunningDocumentTable()\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.KnownBuffersCollection.get_Buffers()\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.DefaultScriptContextProvider.RefreshOpenDocumentList(Action callback, Nullable`1 delay, Boolean scriptConfigurationChanged)\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.DefaultScriptContextProvider.OnTextViewClosed(ITextView textView)\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.VsTextViewCreationListener.<>c__DisplayClass2.<VsTextViewCreated>b__1(Object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n   at Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Utilities.GuardedOperations.RaiseEvent(Object sender, EventHandler eventHandlers)</description>\r\n  </entry>\r\n",

I now can't get intellisense nor formatting to work and often find there is a second copy of the .TS file loaded and changes can disappear. This is a C# project with the TS files as part of the project.\n\nThis is very annoying and even crippling.",

      "Message": "I just want to add that it is very difficult to use Typescript when my changes keep disappearing because it seems VS is maintaining multiple copies of the .TS file. This is such an up front bug that I'm surprised not to be seeing other reports. But I'm used to finding bugs simply by using products slightly out of the original design point.\n\nI'd be glad to work with someone from the TS stream to figure out what is happening. Otherwise I may have to retire from using TS.",
