    "Description": "UMD  is the combined commonJS + AMD header you see a lot for JavaScript modules on bower:\r\n\r\n> UMD (Universal Module Definition) patterns for JavaScript modules that work everywhere.\r\n\r\nExamples: https://github.com/umdjs/umd\r\n\r\nThis would add a `umd` value to the module codegen (besides `commonjs` and `amd`).\r\n\r\nOf course we can convert this UMD header block from the existing modules with tools found on npm, but they ruin the source-maps. So it would be very slick if the compiler can output universal modules directly.",
