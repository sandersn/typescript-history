    "Description": "Hi\r\n\r\nIf you have a typescript file in a project, with compile on save enabled, such as the one below, then this causes the error \"Output Generation Failed\" to appear in the status bar. It does not give any indication of the reason for the error.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class Test{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following obviously works fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Test{ \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor putting it inside a module:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule Library {\r\n    export class Test{\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously this is because the export is not inside a module, so there is not where to export FROM. However it took me far to long to work this out today without a meaning full error.\r\n\r\nThis is version 0.9.5 btw, in Visual Studio 2012.",
