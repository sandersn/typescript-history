    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have found a big issue, in a complex .ts file I need many libs and plugins, like jQuery, jQuery UI and many plugins.\r\n\r\nSo I have to put in every .ts file I work on the references.\r\nSo, I thought it would be smart to have \"_references.js\" file with all the TypeScript definition files and do only this:\r\n/// <reference path=\"..\\..\\..\\TypeScript\\Definitions\\_references.js\" />\r\n\r\nGreat, in my editor no errors, and no red lines, but on the right side in the generated JavaScript windows are many errors, that the name '$' does not exist and so on, if I copy the references out of the \"_references.js\" file directly in my .ts file, everything worked fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards",
