Fourslash tests are for language service features (ex if you were adding a 'protected' keyword you would write fourslash tests to verify the completion list shows and doesn't show the protected member in various places). The tests in .../tests/cases/compiler and /tests/cases/conformance are for verifying error messages, type checking, and emit (obviously these then also verify parsing at a high level and you likely don't need to write Fidelity tests). <br />\n",
