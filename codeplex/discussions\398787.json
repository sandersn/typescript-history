It's really a bad practice, but I understand that there are sometimes reasons for wanting to do it.</p>",

You'd still have to include the typescript compiler as js and it would be slow so at that point you might as well just not do it at all. But it is still fun. The coffeescript website has an example of doing this in coffeescript, same principle here really.</p>",
