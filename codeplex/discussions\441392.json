Right now the main library and the aggregate, bindings and time extensions are done.<br />\n<br />\nThis is my first definition file so I am sure there are things I have not considered that I need to, so if you find any bugs or have suggestions, please share!<br />\n<br />\nAside: Of interest to others converting vsdoc/intellisense files to TypeScript definitions, I have also created a small <a href=\"https://github.com/egil/VSDocJSDocConverter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windows program named VSDocJSDocConverter</a> that makes it easy to convert VsDoc comments to JsDoc comments.<br />\n<br />\nBest, Egil.<br />\n",
