      "Message": "Thanks for reporting this issue.  I do see this error in our Playground, so it definitely does appear to be an issue in 0.9.1.1.  I just tried in our develop branch however, and the issue is resolved, so it appears we have fixed this issue (either deliberately or as a side-effect of another fix), and it shouldn't be an issue in the next release.  (Feel free to pull on our 'develop' branch and give it a whirl).  Thanks!",
