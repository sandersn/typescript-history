    "Html": "Certainly this was considered (everyone on the team has a strong C# background and we have been known to accidently write type-first code on the whiteboard).\r<br />\n<br />\nThe main problem is that we needed to add types in a way that felt natural with the existing JavaScript syntax. It's not clear how you would add type annotations to function return types (especially for function expressions) or var declarations. If you look at other OO/functional languages like F# and Scala, you'll see they use very similar syntax.<br />\n",

    "Html": ":-/ well what feels natural to me is type-first annotation, anyways the effort is pulling different sides and by that I mean that either TypeScript stays close (and constrained) to javascript &quot;look and feel&quot; syntax or it keeps enhancing javascript by adding whatever is needed as long as it is done in a neat and elegant way.\r<br />\n<br />\nThat's a question that could/should be asked to the community if they prefer &quot;function greeter(person : Person)&quot; vs &quot;function greeter( Person person )&quot; ^_^\r<br />\n<br />\nOn a side note, I'm planning to rewrite the major version of my JavaScript Framework using TypeScript and I don't mind if later I have to rewrite the whole thing with the type-first annotation.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for your quick response Ryan :)<br />\n",
