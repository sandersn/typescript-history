    "Description": "We have code that should only be included in debug builds. To remove code form release builds, we use ajaxmin debug comments (http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Preprocessor).\r\n\r\nTypeScript removes some of those debug comments. If a comment is removed or not seems to depend on the type of statement that immediately follows the comment.\r\n\r\nIn this case, both the DEBUG and ENDDEBUG comments are included in the output:\r\n```\r\n///#DEBUG\r\n    var e = Sys.ParameterValidation.validate(arguments, [\r\n    { name: \"aHandler\", type: Function }\r\n]);\r\n///#ENDDEBUG\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the following code, tsc removes the DEBUG comment (the ENDDEBUG is still included in the output):\r\n```\r\n///#DEBUG\r\n   if (arguments.length !== 0) throw new ParameterCountError();;\r\n///#ENDDEBUG\r\n```\r\n\r\nTypeScript should never remove ajaxmin preprocessor comments (///#)\r\n",
