      "Message": "HI,\n\nI have vs2012 and there is no Script section. I could find the ts file template inside the root Visual C#, but not in any of the subcategories: Code, Web etc....\n\nI noticed that the  TypeScript File contains a definition for an ipothetic Shape class. I think it should be just an empty file or maybe two templates: Empty TypeScript File, Demo TypeScript File...\n\nThanks",
