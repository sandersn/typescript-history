    "Description": "Hi, to reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Enter the following bit of text in any TypeScript file in Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        // Foo/Bar/Baz\r\n        // Foo-Bar-Baz\r\n        // Foo+=Bar+=Baz\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Copy any single line of text, omitting the comment slash, e.g. copy \"Foo/Bar/Baz\" into the clipboard.\r\n\r\n* Paste it back into the TypeScript file.\r\n\r\n* The pasted text is rendered with code formatting:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFoo{space}/{space}Bar{space}/{space}Baz\r\n```\r\n\r\nText pasted from the clipboard should not undergo any formatting. \r\n\r\nThis is the behaviour in other code files in Visual Studio, such as C#.",

      "Message": "I believe the \"Automatically format on paste\" behaviour in the TypeScript editor is a bit faulty.\n\nI already have this checked for C# but the C# edit does not have the behaviour that I described in my original post. I think the C# editor is clever enough to only attempt to format pasted text that was already formatted when it was copied to the clipboard.\n\nIf I uncheck the TypeScript option \"Format on paste\" then nothing gets formatted on paste, for example copying and pasting a method within a class leads to unformatted code.\n\nI would like to keep \"Format on paste\" on, but that shouldn't attempt to format previously unformatted text pasted from the clipboard.",
