    "Description": "\r\n\r\nI have supplied the overloaded declaration for postMessage to represent the message-only signature (rather than the lib.d.ts three-argument version).\r\n\r\n    declare function postMessage(message: any): void;\r\n\r\nI get no visual errors, red squiggles etc, but I do get a build error.\r\n\r\n    Build: Supplied parameters do not match any signature of call target.\r\n    Build: Could not select overload for 'call' expression.\r\n\r\nOn this line:\r\n\r\n    postMessage(message);\r\n\r\nI can overload other function declarations, but not those in lib.d.ts.\r\n\r\nI also tried adding it as an overload to the Window interface, but got a duplicate identifier error:\r\n\r\n    interface Window {\r\n        postMessage: (message: any) => void;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBoth of these seem to work in the Playground just fine.",
