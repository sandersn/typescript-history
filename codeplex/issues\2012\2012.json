    "Description": "I have simplified the code that shows the wrong error with TypeScript 0.9.5:\r\n```\r\nif (true) {\r\n\tvar bridge = {\r\n\t\ttest1: () => false, // Returns boolean\r\n\t\ttest2: () => bridge.test1() // So this should return boolean too, but it is recognized as any\r\n\t};\r\n} else {\r\n\tvar bridge = {\r\n\t\ttest1: () => false,\r\n\t\ttest2: () => false\r\n\t};\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt shows the error:\r\n\"Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type. Variable 'bridge' must be of type '{ test1: () => boolean; test2: () => __any__; }', but here has type '{ test1: () => boolean; test2: () => __boolean__; }'.\"\r\n",
