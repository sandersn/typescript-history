    "Description": "It seems that TypeScript compiler \"tsc\" just cann't read file in UTF-8 with BOM - such files are created by Visual Studio by default. After that they cann't be compiled by tsc - without any error message. When such file is referenced via \"///' comment - tsc treated them as if they are just empty.\r\n\r\nIt's very annoying - remove BOM manually after each new \"*.ts\" file creation in VisualStudio.",
