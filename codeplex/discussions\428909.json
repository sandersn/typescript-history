I've discovered that as the project gets larger, the TypeScript plugin for Visual Studio starts slowing down, sometimes dramatically, to the point where Visual\r\n Studio will frequently lock up for 10-20 seconds before accepting input again. So far as I can tell, this seems to happen because of the TS language service trying to parse the files. It especially seems to happen when there's a syntax error of some sort within\r\n the file I'm editing - the sort you get and fix a thousand times a day while you're in the process of editing your code.</p>\r\n<p>It's getting worse, and is beginning to affect productivity.</p>\r\n<p>Do you know when the next drop of the VS plugin is going to be? Any tips for getting the best performance until then?</p>\r\n",

The evidence that it's not related to Web Essentials is that the freeze generally happens when I'm in the process of making live edits, before I save anything. Once I'm able\r\n to save a file, it generally builds within a second or so.</p>\r\n<p>- My machine is a 32-bit machine, 3-4 years old, 4 GB of RAM, and a good SSD.
