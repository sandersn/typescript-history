    "Description": "Browser engines do dead code elimination at runtime. It's good, but it means useless code is being sent through the network to the browser. It'd be good if tooling like TypeScript helped to eliminate useless code *before* it gets sent to the wire.\r\n\r\nDart can do tree shaking https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=9RCuW6K1afs#t=1978 It'd be interesting to see an equivalent feature in TypeScript.",
