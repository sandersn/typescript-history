    "ClosedComment": "Thanks for reporting this. I tried this in the 0.9 version of the compiler in the develop branch and get the error as expected using the following snippet:\n\n````\nclass C {\n    private sendJsonAsync = function (url, json) { }\n    public sendJsonAsync = function (url, json) { }\n}\n````\n\nIs this what you tried? Can you post a more complete sample if you did something different. Thanks!",

    "Description": "Just coming to TypeScript and CodePlex.\r\n\r\nI converted a file that had two functions in it (notice the underscore):\r\n\r\n_sendJsonAsync = function ( url, json )  and\r\nsendJsonAsync = function ( url, json )\r\n\r\nIn typescript I changed this to:\r\n\r\nprivate  sendJsonAsync = function ( url, json )  and\r\npublic   sendJsonAsync = function ( url, json )\r\n\r\nSince they were far apart in the file I couldn't see the obvious __but the typescript compiler didn't warn or produce an error either__ which caused my app to stop working because of \"infinite recursion\".\r\n\r\nAnyway I changed them back to the first naming convention in typescript:\r\n\r\nprivate  _sendJsonAsync = function ( url, json )  and\r\npublic   sendJsonAsync = function ( url, json )\r\n\r\n",
