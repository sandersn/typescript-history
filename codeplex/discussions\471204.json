I'm trying to use TS with Node.js framework, but it's a little tricky. \r<br />\n<br />\nI added a question on stackoverflow: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20219450/typescript-use-typescript-require-shared-files\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20219450/typescript-use-typescript-require-shared-files</a> \r<br />\n<br />\nIn summary, I can't use the keyword extends on my classes if I do inheritance, it's not working, the class is not found if I add the keyword. \r<br />\nIt's one issue. \r<br />\n<br />\nMaybe do you have some tips for Node.js use? I tried the typescript-required but that's not working, (see the link), do you have any solution? \r<br />\n<br />\nWhat I want to do is to have files shared between the server and the client, that means the server will use directly the file wrote using TypeScript but the client will get the file merged with a lot of other files and zipped and I need that files are compatible with both client (browser) and server. \r<br />\n<br />\nThank you for your help.\r<br />\n<br />\nPS: I use WebStorm 7.1 IDE.<br />\n",
