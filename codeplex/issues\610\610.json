    "Description": "I know this has been reported in other forums, but I've never seen a resolution.  In a project with TS objects under source control, a TS script with references will not compile on save unless those referenced scripts are also checked out.  In a project with multiple developers, this causes lots of problems.  I have seen a suggested solution that says to turn off the web essentials \"Compile TypeScript on save\" option and turn on the \"Compile all TypeScript files on build\" option, but that setting checks out every typescript object when it builds.  Again, in a multi-user project, this is not feasible.\r\n\r\nSince the error is occurring in tsc.js, is that something that has or will be corrected in the .8.2 release?  Is there a usable workaround?\r\n\r\n\r\n    /*\r\n    \r\n    Compile Error. \r\n    See error list for details\r\n     tsc.js(23862, 29) Microsoft JScript runtime error: Write to file failed.\r\n    \r\n    */",
