So currently it's not possible to run make on *nix or cygwin, which is another issue.\n\nIn addition, for people who want to try running \"make\", you have to \"set TYPESCRIPT_HOST=node\" before you run.",

      "Message": "@Mahlzeit\n\nThe problem is, even if you could get NMake running with wine. You'd still need to run node.js with wine in order to build these *.ts files. I don't know whether node is supported by wine, and even if it is supported, it's obviously not a good way.\n\nSo, I've wrote another makefile.
