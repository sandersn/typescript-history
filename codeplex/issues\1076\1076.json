    "Description": "node.js >= v0.11.2 have support for generators using the --harmony option so you can run this code: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4Qu_52vHH3jOHYxNXpfSDBrQ1k/view\r\n\r\nAlso you can use traceur-compiler to convert generators into plain ES3.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if typescript alowed that syntax to be valid adding an ES6 target or something (even if it doesn't generate ES3 code and consideers yield to return the any type). That would allow to have typings and autocompletion and using generators and linear async with generators.\r\n\r\nIn order to use generators we would need:\r\nfunction*() { } and yield keyword.",
