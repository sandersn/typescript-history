    "Description": "After making changes to several files and then selecting SaveAll the tsc -w process recompiles the entire project once for each file.  A tiny delay before compiling should resolve this.  Would also be nice if a simple status was output (waiting, compiling, aborting, complete) and not a list of every file being compiled.\r\n\r\nI found this helpful as an temporary solution to build status: \r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/17592368/output-build-complete-when-typescript-compiler-is-done",
