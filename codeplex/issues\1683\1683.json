    "Description": "I am running VS2013 RC. When I FIle->New Project and create a Typescript Project, or I create an MVC5 project that has no authentication or has \"Individual User Authentication,\" TypeScript debugging works fine; however, when I create an MVC5 project using Windows Authentication (not Organizational), TypeScript debugging in Visual Studio does not work. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling VS2013 RC.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this issue, in VS 2013 RC do the following:\r\n\r\nFile->New Project. Choose Templates/Visual C#/Web/ASP.NET Web Application\r\n\r\nChoose .Net Framework 4.5 or 4.5.1, doesn't matter\r\nClick OK\r\nChoose MVC template\r\nClick Change Authentication and choose Windows Authentication\r\nClick OK\r\nClick Create Project\r\nOnce Project is loaded,\r\nRight click Scripts folder Add->TypeScript File\r\nLeave as default file1\r\nClick  OK\r\nClick No in dialog offering to search Nuget for typings\r\nI generally add an alert(\"here\"); to the generated file1.ts just to make absolutely sure that it is being compiled.\r\nSet a breakpoint on the \"var p: IPoint = new Shapes.Point(3, 4);\" line in file1.ts\r\nIn file Views/Home/Index.cshtml add the following:\r\n\r\n@section Scripts {\r\n    @Scripts.Render(\"~/Scripts/file1.js\")\r\n}\r\n\r\nPress F5 to run project.\r\n\r\nAlert will pop up showing js file was compiled and ran successfully, but the debugger will not break on the breakpoint that was created.\r\n\r\nThis issue cost me a day of troubleshooting yesterday. Any help or a fix would be greatly appreciated.",
