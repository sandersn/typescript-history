    "Description": "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI think that the ErrorEventHandler interface in lib.d.ts is possibly mis-defined.  It is currently defined as:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface ErrorEventHandler {\r\n    (event: Event, source: string, fileno: number, columnNumber: number): void;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning with IE 10 (haven't tried 11) the definition appears to be more accurately defined as:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface ErrorEventHandler {\r\n    (error: string, source: string, lineNumber: number, columnNumber: number): void;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this seems to be backed up by this:\r\n\r\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/cc197053(v=vs.85).aspx\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that ```fileno``` is just a typo and meant to be ```lineNumber``` or ```lineno```.  What's more relevant to me is that ```error```/```event``` appears to always be a ```string```; and never an ```Event```.\r\n\r\nI realise this has been raised already with: https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/1570 but it doesn't seem to have been satisfactorily resolved.\r\n\r\nAre there any further thoughts on this?\r\n\r\nFor now I'm getting round it by casting like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nwindow.onerror = function (event: Event, source: string, lineNumber: number, columnNumber: number) {\r\n    var error = <string><any>event;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich seems a bit wrong...",
