    "Description": "I have generated a TypeScript definition for OpenLayers by parsing the OpenLayers source. The definition compiles fine and can also be used to some extent. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that OpenLayers have namespaces and classes with the same name. I have found out that this should be supported in TypeScript 0.9 and that the class and module is merged.\r\n\r\nFor me this works fine when creating new instances of classes but not when accessing class attributes or returning a class instance from a function.\r\n\r\nFor example OpenLayers has a class called OpenLayers.Layer. This is also a module. The code below works fine down to the indicated row where the compiler mix up the class OpenLayers.Layer with the module OpenLayers.Layer.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar mapElement: HTMLElement = document.getElementById(\"map\");\r\nvar map: OpenLayers.Map = new OpenLayers.Map(mapElement, {});\r\nvar layer: OpenLayers.Layer = new OpenLayers.Layer.OSM(\"OpenStreetMap\");\r\nmap.addLayer(layer);\r\nmap.setCenter(\r\n    new OpenLayers.LonLat(-71.147, 42.472).transform(\r\n        new OpenLayers.Projection(\"EPSG:4326\"), map.getProjectionObject()),\r\n    12);  \r\n\r\n// This will not compile since there is a mix-up between the \r\n// class and module called Openlayers.Layer.\r\nvar l: OpenLayers.Layer = map.layers[0];\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee attached file for the complete code.",
