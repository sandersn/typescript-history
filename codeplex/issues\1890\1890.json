    "Description": "I have a project https://github.com/BBGONE/jRIAppTS\r\nwhich stopped to compile normally after adding demoDB.ts module.\r\nAfter trying to compile it , there's two errors\r\n>C:/DATA/TEST/jriappTS/jriappTS/user_modules/demoDB.ts(279,22): error TS2137: Class RIAPP.DEMODB.CustomerAddress declares interface RIAPP.DEMODB.ICustomerAddressEntity but does not implement it:\r\n1>C:/DATA/TEST/jriappTS/jriappTS/user_modules/demoDB.ts(289,13): error TS2096: 'get' and 'set' accessor must have the same type.\r\n\r\nI checked the code, it is all ok. I don't see any problems with what the compiler saying.\r\nI attached a project which you can try to compile. It is a reduced version of the whole project.\r\nYou can use compile.bat to compile it from the command line or to open it in VS2012 and build it there.\r\n\r\nIt is at line 279 and 289 in user_modules/demoDB.ts\r\n```\r\nexport class CustomerAddress extends RIAPP.MOD.db.Entity implements ICustomerAddressEntity\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease, check it out. Because 0.9.1.1 version of the compiler is very unreliable. And can complain at what is a good  code. \r\n",
