    "Description": "Is the playgoung implementation of renaming the same as your production version? It does not seem to respect scoping too well. Consider\n\nvar b;\nfunction F(a) { b; }\n\nThe playground will let me rename 'a' to 'b' (capturing the inner 'b') as well as rename 'b' to 'a' (again, capturing the inner occurrence).\n\nHaving implemented a (variable-only) renaming for JS myself, I was curious. You can find my version (with demo, source and tests) here: http://clausreinke.github.com/estr/\n\nPS. How do I add a component (playground, language services) to a ticket here?",
