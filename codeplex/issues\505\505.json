    "Description": "I should be able to execute this command line:\n\ntsc \"..\\UnitTests\\*.ts\" -target ES5\n\nNote the use of *.ts. Right now I am forced to list each of my .ts files like this:\n\ntsc \"..\\UnitTests\\ArrayTests.ts\" \"..\\UnitTests\\StringTests.ts\" -target ES5\n\nThis is tedious, un-maintainable, and error prone, especially if you consider the above example where I am relying on passing all of my unit tests using an automated build script. If I forget to include one script, then I might mistakenly think my tests are all passing.\n\nHere's a workaround, but the wildcard syntax is much nicer and more efficient:\n\nfor /r \"..\\UnitTests\" %%I in (\"*.ts\") do tsc \"%%I\" -target ES5",

      "Message": "I used to get free glob support by linking my old C programs with setargv.obj (e.g., http://forums.devshed.com/c-programming-42/linking-to-setargv-obj-and-wildcards-90462.html).\n\nIs there something similar for whatever tsc.exe is written in?\n\nIt would be *really* handy to be able to type:\n\n```\ntsc *.ts\n```\n\nto compile all the TypeScript in my project directory.  As billyzkid said, it is unmaintainable to have to list each file on the command line.  The similar command for, say, C++ works fine:\n\n```\ncl *.cpp\n```\n\nPlease add simple globbing support to tsc.",
