    "Description": "In vs 2013 and win 8.1. When I create a new project with the \"HTML application with TypeScript\" template I always get an error  on build (starting with \"The AssignTargetPath\" could not be loaded\"). I also get the same error whenever I try to add typescript to an existing working project.\r\nIf I remove the typescript Import line from the project file then the project complies but then compiling ts files and debugging is not working (unless I compile using the console). I mean this line in .csproj file: \r\n> <Import Project=\"$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v$(VisualStudioVersion)\\TypeScript\\Microsoft.TypeScript.targets\" Condition=\"Exists('$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v$(VisualStudioVersion)\\TypeScript\\Microsoft.TypeScript.targets')\" />\r\n\r\n__Error message:__\r\n> Error\t1\tThe \"AssignTargetPath\" task could not be loaded from the assembly Microsoft.Build.Tasks, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a.

      "Message": "We did have a bug in a prior release with a localized DLL not loading, but that was fixed in the latest 0.9.5 release.  Could you please clarify for me which version of TypeScript you are using?  Also, which language Visual Studio do you have installed?\n\nDid this ever work?  Or is this the first time attempting to use TypeScript and you've always got the error on this machine?\n\nDo you have anything installed to non-standard paths?  (i.e. VS installed elsewhere than under \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\")\n\nDoes everything else in TypeScript appear to be working?  (i.e. you get syntax colorization, the language service is providing intellisense and drop-downs, etc...)\n\nWe'll try to reproduce locally or come up with other possible issues once we have the answers to the above.  Thanks.",
