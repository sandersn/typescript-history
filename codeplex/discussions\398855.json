This, of\r\n course, would only be done when the compiler is run in a &quot;Release&quot; configuration.</p>\r\n<p>With all of the rich type information the compiler knows about the code, it should be able to perform more aggressive optimizations (variable renaming/elimination, function inlining) than your average minifier. This makes it potentially far more powerful\r\n than a post-build minifier.</p>\r\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\r\n",
