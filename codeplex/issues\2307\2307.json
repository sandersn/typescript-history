    "Description": "Currently, when there are type errors, `tsc` returns 1 as its exit code, but still generates code. However, if there are fatal errors, like a parse error, `tsc` will also return exit code 1, but fail to generate code. It would be useful to me if `tsc` could generate a different error code in this case. This would allow a build system to continue in one case (with the type errors as warnings), but fail in the other (instead of e.g. using a stale file from a previous run).",
