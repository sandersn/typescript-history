    "Description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have noticed this bug in the Eclipse plugin for TypeScript, and the developer thinks the problem is with the getReferencesAtPosition API. The WebStorm implementation seems to have the same bug.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface IFoo {\r\n    bar();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Foo implements IFoo {\r\n    bar() {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRenaming the bar method in IFoo does not affect the method in Foo, and vice versa. And also:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Foo {\r\n    method() {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Bar extends Foo {\r\n    method() {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRenaming Foo.method does not affect Bar.method, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThis issue could possibly introduce new bugs when refactoring method names in a large project. Such a problem may even go undetected by the compiler â€“ especially for the second case.",
