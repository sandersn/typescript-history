Instead of manually compiling .ts files, you just write them\r\n inside HTML page in <em>&lt;script type=&quot;text/typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</em> tag. The code is then automatically compiled and run upon page load.</p>\r\n<p>Please have a look at the demo included and fork the repo if you'd like to help make it better.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the lib.d.ts header file, which contains definitions of many DOM objects, is very heavy and it needs to be compiled each time, so I am considering ommiting it in next releases. But then the compiler will throw errors like\r\n<em>&quot;The name 'IArguments' does not exist in the current scope&quot;</em> in the console. Please have your say in\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/niutech/typescript-compile/issues/1\">this issue</a>.</p>\r\n",
