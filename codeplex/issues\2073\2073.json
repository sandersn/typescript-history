    "Description": "I use Shift+Delete instead of Ctrl+X. In TypeScript Playground, this shortcut still removes the selected text, but it doesn't allow the text to go into the clipboard, so when I paste, the _previous_ clipboard contents are pasted.\r\n\r\nShift+Delete works in normal browser text inputs. It's just TypeScript Playground that doesn't support it.",

(Note: They do currently document SHIFT+DEL as \"Delete current line\", not \"Cut current line\", so it may be by design and not something they will change - but I'll try :-)   ).",

      "Message": "Yes, that is by design but not because we don't want it but because most browsers don't allow us to write to the clipboard. The fact, that Ctrl+[c|v|x] work is due to a well engineered trick that doesn't work in the context of Shift+Del. However, IE does allow to write to the clipboard and we have added a story to expose that. Please stay tuned.",

      "Message": "Why do you need programmatic access to the clipboard? Can't you just let the browser handle the cut, copy and paste shortcuts so the text box works in whichever way is native to the browser and OS?",
