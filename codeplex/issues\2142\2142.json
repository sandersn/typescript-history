    "Description": "Yesterday, mde released a [new version of utilities 0.0.30](https://npmjs.org/package/utilities) (a dependency of jake) that causes new builds of TS to fail.\r\n\r\nI've opened an issue already [here](https://github.com/mde/utilities/issues/12) with a resolution. Someone else has since opened a PR with a (proper?) fix.\r\n\r\nIf it's a big deal to the TS devs that they don't get impacted by dependencies breaking like this, perhaps you want to look at [npm-shrinkwrap](https://npmjs.org/doc/shrinkwrap.html) instead of using \"jake: latest\" in package.json",
