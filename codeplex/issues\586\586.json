    "Description": "Currently, typescript assumes that modules are namespaced.\n\nFor example,\n\nAn exported class defined at \"/my/module\" called MyModule\n\nimport myModule = module(\"my/module\"); \n\nwould need to be accessed by myModule.MyModule\n\nIn dojo, the AMD modules aren't namespaced, but typescript prevents you from accessing \"myModule\" as if it were a class or an interface.\n\nIn order to fix this, either:\na) Allow developers to cast the module variable immediately to a predefined interface\nb) Allow syntax that specifies that the imported module isn't namespaced\n\n\nLikewise, we require the ability to export a class or module without namespacing it internally. This ensures that mixins can gracefully happen between dojo and typescript files.",
