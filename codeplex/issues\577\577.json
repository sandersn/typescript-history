    "Description": "Thanks.  I'll copy this to an issue for tracking.  As for if you are just declaring (rather than implementing) the class, you can do as we do for the types in lib.d.ts, namely:\n\n\n\n\ndeclare interface MyInterface {\n    [index: string]: Date;\n    [index: number]: Event;\n    test(): number;\n}\n\ndeclare var MyClass: {\n    new (): MyInterface;\n}\n\nvar x = new MyClass();\nvar m1 = x[\"test\"]; // m1 is of type Date\nvar m2 = x[5];      // m2 is of type Event\nx.test();",
