      "Message": "constructor, as with most names, is a valid member name on an object, so it is valid to specify it in an interface.  For example, the below is perfectly valid.\n```\ninterface ISome {\n    constructor(URL: string); // must fire an error here - bit does not\n    private: string;\n}\n\nvar x: ISome = {\n    constructor: function (a: string) { } ,\n    private: \"hi\"\n};\n```\n\nWriting a class that implements this interface is tricky, as if you start a class statement with \"constructor\" it will think you are writing the constructor method.  However this can be written by prefixing with the 'public' modifier to indicate it is a member, as shown below:\n\n```\nclass Foo implements ISome {\n    public constructor: (a: string) => void;\n    constructor() {\n        // The actual 'constructor' for the class\n    }\n    private = \"test\";\n}\n```\n",
