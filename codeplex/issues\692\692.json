      "Message": "Thanks for bringing this to our attention, from what we've deduced there is a bug occurring here.\n\nHowever the bug is that the implementation of MyClass should be available to handle receiving no parameters since the spec states that any implementation is allowed to handle fewer arguments than the interface expects. Worst case scenario is you pass the method no parameters, and so your implementation must be able to handle that.\n\nI've marked this active :)",
