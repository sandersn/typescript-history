See http://es5.github.com/#x8.7 .  The grammar also permits it).",

    "Description": "Hi, in the code below the incomplete statement \"var sumin = new\" is compiling by concatenating the next line and automatically adding parentheses to the assumed type:\r\n\r\nclass RudeBoy {\r\n\r\n\tprivate greeting;\r\n\t\r\n\tpublic greet() {\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tvar sumin = new\r\n\t\tthis.greeting = \"Hello, *@#!!\";\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t//Compiles to\r\n\t\t//var sumin = new this.greeting() = \"Hello, *@#!!\";\r\n\t\t\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n",
