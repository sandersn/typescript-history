Sometimes they take weekends off, when we let them :)\n\nIf you see something 'fixed' but it's still a problem working from the latest sources in the develop branch, please do let us know. The Visual Studio components are not part of the CodePlex project, so this only applies to the compiler itself. Thanks!",
