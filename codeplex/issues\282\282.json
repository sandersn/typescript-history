    "Description": "Defining several properties in a class definition using get and set clauses  after compilation results in several Object.defineProperty clauses. Java Script files are getting bloated, when the class uses many such properties.\r\nRather than using Object.defineProperty javascript function, it could be more efficient to use Object.defineProperties(object, descriptors) function and combine several property definitions in one property descriptor.\r\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff800817%28v=vs.94%29.aspx\r\n",
