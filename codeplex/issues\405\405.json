If you do still see the issue,  please attach a sample file as we've had problems specific to how the input file was encoded. Thanks!",

There's a couple of issues on encoding around on the issue tracker, yet none of the tickets provides a working solution.\nI'm sorry, but improper encoding is a no-go nowadays, especially when the rest of the typescript project is so good.\n\nAny fix would be _highly_ appreciated.\n\nThank you for your work!",
