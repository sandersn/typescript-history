      "Message": "In the long term, we expect TypeScript to include everything that becomes part of future versions of ECMAScript.  In some cases, these will only be available when targeting newer browsers, when the feature relies upon some new runtime capability.  But in many cases, where the features are just syntactic sugar, we expect to be able to compile to simple and clean JavaScript for ES3/ES5 which implements a very good approximation.\n\nDestructuring in particular is in the second bucket, so is something we would expect to be able to support in the future even when targeting ES3/ES5 environments.",
