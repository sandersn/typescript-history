    "Description": "I'm not sure if this is an issue, but I have been using the Map type as the equivalent of the Dictionary of C# compiling my code in ES3; now I found that Map is part of the ES6 and it's compatible only from IE11, that caused me some problems.\r\n\r\nhttp://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/\r\nhttp://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:simple_maps_and_sets\r\n\r\nIs it wrong that TypeScript allows me to use Map while I'm using ES3 compilation? Shouldn't it give me an error like when you try to use properties in ES3?, if it should allow me to use the Map type, what are the limitations talking about compatibility?\r\n\r\nThanks.",

      "Message": "The reason is that Map is defined in lib.d.ts and lib.d.ts contains everything from ES5 and the parts of ES6 that IE11 supports. Thus the TS compiler itself has nothing to give you an error about.\n\nThere is [this workitem](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/978) to split lib.d.ts into parts but it only talks about splitting browser parts off from it. You might want to add there that you want .d.ts files specific to ES versions (ecma3.d.ts, ecma5.d.ts, ecma6.d.ts, etc.)",
