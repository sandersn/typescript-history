Have looked all over for a solution while spending days trying to figure it all out to no avail. Please help, I'm soooooooooo completely confused!\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm not using Visual Studio, but rather WebStorm. This shouldn't really matter however.\r<br />\nI'm using TS 9.1, AngularJS 1.0.7, RequireJS 2.1.8.\r<br />\nI've also tried using DefinitelyTyped's angular.d.td, but it's not helping.\r<br />\n<br />\nDoes anyone have a simple example of a TS angular app module for app init, with another TS angular module that has a controller, being loaded with RequireJS, referencing &quot;DefinitelyTyped/angularjs/angular.d.ts&quot;, and calling 'angular.module' to define themselves, and then referencing the controller in a web page?\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease, help.... I'm burning in TypeScript, RequireJS, AngularJS module hell.<br />\n",

You simply specify the file that is the entry point in terms of dependencies and Browserify will figure out the rest. It compiles everything down to one file while keeping all the modules isolated from each other.\r<br />\n<br />\nHighly recommended reading: <a href=\"http://www.100percentjs.com/just-like-grunt-gulp-browserify-now/\" rel=\"nofollow\">And just like that Grunt and RequireJS are out, itâ€™s all about Gulp and Browserify now</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nFor me, a big win has been the ability to package by feature instead of by layer, easily sharing some code between Node.js and AngularJS because they now use the same module system, at least at the source level.<br />\n",
