    "Description": "Right now the only provided plugin with good TypeScript support is for Visual Studio 2012. The plugins for the other editors only provide basic syntax highlighting. So if you are not developing on Windows, you are currently out of luck.\r\n\r\nHowever the playground editor also provides things like code completion. And since it runs within a browser, it could easily serve as the foundation for a new group of editors that would be available on all platforms (for example using node-webkit as the rendering platform).",
