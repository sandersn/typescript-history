    "Description": "This 1.0RC version has some bugs, previously it worked better:\r\n\r\n1- The \"refactor\" function stopped working in my VS2013\r\n2- Typescript get confused about a variable passed in the costructor and a parameter with the same name in a class method...\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass SectionList {\r\n    constructor(data: any) {\r\n        if (data) {\r\n            this.fillData(data);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    fillData = (data: any) => {\r\n    \r\n        // this data is marked as wrong\r\n        if (data=!null) {\r\n            //.......\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n3- this will be a fantastic new feature:\r\n\r\nlike Eclipse, when someone changes a .ts file that causes a problem on others .ts files in the same project, it would be great to be able to see which file is wrong in the \"solution explorer\", maybe using a different icon",
