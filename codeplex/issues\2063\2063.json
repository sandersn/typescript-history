    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nCode lens is a [new feature in Visual Studio 2013](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn269218.aspx).\r\n\r\nAfter working with this on a C# project, I have found it to be a tremendous productivity booster.\r\n\r\nCodeLens provides information about references, unit tests, check-ins etc. I'm not sure how unit tests would be incorporated but simply being able to view the references to a class or method is in itself hugely useful.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
