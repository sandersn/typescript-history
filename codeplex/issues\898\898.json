    "Description": "I have my TS project on Mac and access the project through Win 7 on VMWare Fusion 5. The path to my project is:\r\n\r\n\"//vmware-host/Shared Folders/.../my-ts-project\r\n\r\nlet's say in the project I have a.ts and b.ts in the same directory.\r\n\r\nNow if in file a.ts I use: import a=module(\"b\"); typescript's intellisense does not find b.ts and its contents.\r\n\r\nIf I copy the same project on my Windows desktop directory, the same things works just fine.\r\n\r\nNote: this problem does not occur for references, i.e., ///<reference path=\"b.ts\" /> would work just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
