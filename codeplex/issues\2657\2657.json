    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe use Visual Studio 2013 Premium Update 4 and develop applications in TypeScript 1.4. We have a very serious issue, when we start debugging the code, entering into another method in another class would freeze the whole Visual Studio. It is then stalled for at least few minutes. The only way to quickly work with the Visual Studio again is by terminating the Visual Studio process from the task manager and restart the application again.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to solve this issue? Thanks in advance.",
