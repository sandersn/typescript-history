Number of CPU's, amount of RAM.\n\nWhat are the things you are seeing, lot of tsc.exe process spinning up, high memory consumption?\n\nDo you have extensions installed, like Web Essentials, Resharper? Does uninstalling alleviate the problems you're seeing?\n\nFrom which version did you upgrade?\n\nClosing for tracking. please re-open using the button on top.",
