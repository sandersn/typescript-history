    "Description": "When creating executable scripts, it is typical to start the script with a hash-bang. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/env node\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"tada!\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works fine in 'plain' .js files, but the Typescript compiler doesn't like it.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit dubious whether having `#!/bin/env node` at the top of a .ts file actually makes sense (because Node cannot run the .ts file directly), but if the compiler would simply pass it through to the output, this would be helpful.\r\n\r\nA point of concern is that the line-ending of such a line must be a Unix line-ending (even on Windows), as otherwise the shell will not correctly parse it (it will include the \\r). This in turn will probably force all other line-endings in that file to be Unix too, to prevent messages when opening the file in an editor, source-code-control messages, etc.",
