    "Description": "I've noticed a small issue when adding new files via the VS2012 context menu on a folder. \r\n\r\nNamely that if you try to add a file called MyNameSpace.Class.ts, but there is already a file called MyNameSpace.ts, VS will then say \"A file with the name MyNameSpace.ts alreads exists and is open in an editor. Please give the file a unique name to the item you are adding or delete the existing item first\".\r\n\r\nIt looks like only the name prior to the dot is being checked for uniqueness.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not seen if 'Add New Item' is selected and the window to add different file types is used.\r\n\r\n__Reproduction steps:__\r\n\r\nCreate a new project (mine was a MVC4 SPA)\r\nAdd a new folder\r\nRight click on the folder and select 'Add >'\r\nSelect 'TypeScript File' from the sub menu, enter a name such as MyNamespace.ts or just MyNamespace\r\nRight click on the same folder and select 'Add >'\r\nSelect 'TypeScript file' from the sub menu, enter the name MyNamespace.MyClass.ts or MyNamespace.MyClass\r\nAt this point you should see the prompt.\r\n\r\n__Environment details:__\r\n\r\nWindows 8.1\r\nVS2012 Premium Update 3\r\nWeb Essentials (as of 24th of Aug (the one with no preview window :*( )",
