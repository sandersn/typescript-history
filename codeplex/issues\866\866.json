It looks like the files are being encoded improperly and IE is figuring it out but Chrome and FF aren't...\r\n\r\nFor example\r\nHere are the first few likes of a compiled JS file \r\n/// <reference path=\"../Framework/Core.ts\" />\r\nvar MVVM;\r\n(function (MVVM) {\r\n    var Application = (function () {\r\n        function Application() {\r\n            this.core = undefined;\r\n            this.templatePath = \"Atlatl/Templates/\";\r\n            this.viewPath = \"Atlatl/Views/\";\r\n            this.dependentScriptsPath = \"Scripts/\";\r\n            this.viewModelsPath = \"Atlatl/App/ViewModels/\";\r\n            this.frameworkPath = \"Atlatl/Framework/\";\r\n            this.pages = {\r\n            };\r\n\r\nand here is what Chrome \"thinks\" its receiving from IIS : \r\n 爼晥牥湥散瀠瑡㵨⸢⼮牆浡睥牯⽫潃敲琮≳⼠ാ瘊牡䴠噖㭍਍昨湵瑣潩⁮䴨噖⥍笠਍††慶⁲灁汰捩瑡潩⁮‽昨湵瑣潩⁮⤨笠\r\n\r\nI have tried all the following compilation methods with various failures, all along the same lines\r\n\r\n1) Just using the Typescript compiler in VS\r\n2) Using Web Essentials\r\n     A) With and without UTF-8 BOM flags set to true\r\n     B) With and without recompiling on build\r\n\r\nI can provide a sample project, or if you go thru this tutorial you will see what I am talking about https://github.com/CatapultSystems/atlatl/wiki/Visual-studio-hello-world\r\n\r\nI am totally stumped as to what could be causing this... \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJosh",
