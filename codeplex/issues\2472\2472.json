We've gotten strong feedback both ways on this and there's always the \"Include in Project\" context menu item.\n\nOutput filename is always emitted as you wrote it; we don't second-guess the extension in case you actually did want some other extension.",

    "Description": "I've configured TypeScript to compile all of the output into a single file. I'm using the Project properties in Visual Studio under `TypeScript` called `Combine JavaScript output into file`.\r\n\r\nThe issue are:\r\n\r\n* The JS file and the V3 map file `.map` isn't included as a `DTE.ProjectItem`. Prefeablly, the map file should be nested under the JS file (dependent item).\r\n* If the combined file has no extension, the `.js` extension doesn't get appended automatically. (is it by design?)\r\n\r\nSee how we handled this [in Web Essentials' `ProjectHelpers`](https://github.com/madskristensen/WebEssentials2013/blob/master/EditorExtensions/Shared/Helpers/ProjectHelpers.cs#L442-L499).\r\n\r\nTIA.",
