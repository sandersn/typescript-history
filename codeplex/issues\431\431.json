    "Description": "the production in the PDF is as follows:\r\n\r\n     RestParameter: ... RequiredParameter\r\n\r\nexcept the ... has spaces seperating the dots so that when you search for ... you don't find this text.\r\n\r\nSecondly the text could helpfully use any standard term for supporting functions with variable arguments e..g varargs, variable argument lists, something so that this was easier to find.   This 'rest' parameter thing was not one of my searches in any case.  I had to dig into someone's definitions file to find something that was clearly variable length and then dig into the spec to see why just searching for ... didn't work.\r\n\r\nFurther it doesn't help that the spec also uses ... for 'we're adding a production to the javscript grammar'.\r\n\r\n",
