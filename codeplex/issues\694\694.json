    "Description": "The problem is that my project is in default visual studio path, which has relatively long path and when typescript compiler tries to compile my many source files the total length exceeds the cmd limit which is 8191 characters (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/830473).\r\n\r\nI don't want to move my project location because this limit will be exceeded in the future anyway. Is there a quick workaround for this?",

      "Message": "The compile command for TypeScript is located in the project file (*.jsproj for example):\n```\n<Target Name=\"BeforeBuild\">\n    <Message Text=\"Compiling TypeScript files\" />\n    <Message Text=\"Executing tsc$(TypeScriptSourceMap) @(TypeScriptCompile ->'&quot;%(fullpath)&quot;', ' ')\" />\n    <Exec Command=\"tsc$(TypeScriptSourceMap) @(TypeScriptCompile ->'&quot;%(fullpath)&quot;', ' ')\" /> \n</Target>\n```\nThe last `<Exec>` tag specifies the CMD line to execute. The array of *.ts files `TypeScriptCompile` is built from a special `<ItemGroup>` section:\n```\n<ItemGroup>\n    <TypeScriptCompile Include=\"app.ts\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\nThere are only two solutions I'm thinking of:\n1. Create another special `<ItemGroup>` and a correspondending `<Exec>` command tag.\n\n2. Put the logic of compiling into an external script which actually splits the CMD line.\n\nIt would be (somewhat easily) possible to write a little PowerShell script for both tasks.",
