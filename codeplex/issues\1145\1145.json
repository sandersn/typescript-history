    "Description": "Hi, consider the two classes below in TS 0.9 Beta:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nclass Foo {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        var x = 10;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Bar {\r\n    constructor(\r\n        ) {\r\n            var x = 10;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only difference is that in Bar the parenthesis following the constructor is spread over two lines.\r\n\r\nThis causes the `var x` statement to have an extra indent - __as it is typed out__. \r\n\r\nHitting Control+K, Control+D (format document) reduces the indent to the correct amount.\r\n\r\nHowever, editing `var x =  10` by deleting the closing semicolon and then typing that semicolon again causes `var x = 10` to leap to the right.\r\n\r\nAll this jumping around is driving my cat crazy! \r\n\r\n(this bug was introduced in 0.9 I believe)",
