There has been some discussion about excluding generated .js files from the project.  This will make embedding the files as a resource more difficult.<br />\n\r<br />\nPlease allow the dependent .js file to remain in the project or give the option for including/excluding from the project.   When included in the project please have it work with TFS much the same way that an aspx code behind works, checking out when its dependency (parent) is checked out, and not on every project build.<br />\n",
