    "Description": "Here's one for the \"post-1.0 polish\" bin.\r\n\r\nThe C# editor has beautiful IntelliSense support for filtering for both exact matches and camelCase/PascalCase matches by first letter in each word. So I can type \"DT\" and get back \"DateTime\".\r\n\r\nPlease implement this as soon as possible in the TypeScript editor; it's super-helpful for larger codebases.\r\n\r\nThanks for getting TypeScript to the point where it is today! :)",
