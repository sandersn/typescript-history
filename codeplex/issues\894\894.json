    "Description": "I am having an issue with the typescript visual studio plugin.\r\n\r\nI have a javascript project with about 4000 LoC spread across 15 files that I have converted to use typescript, but when I open it in visual studio I am not getting any intellisense, and the IDE is very slow - sometimes taking several seconds just to respond to keyboard input. The drop down menus at the top of the editor also just show \"Refreshing...\" (see attached screenshot).\r\n\r\nOn a couple occasions I have gotten an error in VS2012 that generated the following exception in ActivityLog.xml:\r\n```\r\nSystem.ArgumentException: Value \"C:/fakepath/Scripts/application-shell.ts\" is invalid for the 'fileName' parameter: the value must should not contain '/' characters Parameter name: C:/fakepath/Scripts/application-shell.ts at \r\nTypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.FileNameScriptId..ctor(String fileName) at \r\nTypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.FileNameScriptId.CreateFileScriptId(String fileName) at \r\nTypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.KnownBuffersCollection.CollectBuffersFromRunningDocumentTable() at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.KnownBuffersCollection.get_Buffers() at \r\nTypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.DefaultScriptContextProvider.RefreshOpenDocumentList(Action callback, Nullable`1 delay) at \r\nTypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.DefaultScriptContextProvider.OnTextViewClosed(ITextView textView) at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.VsTextViewCreationListener.<>c__DisplayClass2.<VsTextViewCreated>b__1(Object sender, EventArgs e) at \r\nMicrosoft.VisualStudio.Text.Utilities.GuardedOperations.RaiseEvent(Object sender, EventHandler eventHandlers)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is the xml in the csproj file for the file causing an error:\r\n```\r\n    <TypeScriptCompile Include=\"Scripts\\application-shell.ts\" />\r\n    <EmbeddedResource Include=\"Scripts\\application-shell.js\">\r\n      <DependentUpon>application-shell.ts</DependentUpon>\r\n    </EmbeddedResource>\r\n```\r\nThere are several other typescript files in the Scripts folder - but only this one is causing an error. I am also able to compile using the typescript compiler just fine - just the editor is causing problems.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is related to the lack of intellisense, but If I create a new typescript project and add a few files, everything still works fine, and I don't get this error.\r\n\r\nAre these two issues related? Or is there another problem I need to fix to get intellisense back? Is there more information I can supply? I am using version 0.8.3.1 of typescript and have tried reinstalling it.",

The project is just a generic c# project, the js files generated by tsc are included as embedded resources (changing them from EmbeddedResources to Content didn't help either).\n\nI did manage to fix the issue by removing all of the .ts files from the folder (but not the project), and then re-adding them one-by-one. I have no idea why this fixed the issue, I will add more information if I run into it again and can come up with better repro steps.",
