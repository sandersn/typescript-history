    "ClosedComment": "This appears to be fixed in the 'develop' branch.\n\nI believe the work-around (only valid on 0.8.1.1 - this will not work in 0.8.2.0!) is to write 'export import' on the import declarations of the second module.",

    "Description": "I have used the node package tsd to install declaration files for node and express. VisualStudio marks a lot of errors, all complaining that an \"interface from a private module is extended\".\r\n\r\nHere's an example: http://pastebin.com/Q4E3mw2z\r\n\r\nThe final line is underlined red and prompts an error message \"exported interface Server extends interface from private module \"NodeEventEmitter\"\"\r\n\r\nThis error message was spread many times across the two definition files. Then I downloaded the node.d.ts definition file from the typescript node sample and without apparent changes in the source code, the errors in node.d.ts were gone. Unfortunately the errors in express.d.ts persisted.\r\n\r\nIn order to reproduce the problem you can:\r\n1. install the node module tsd\r\n2. navigate to an empty folder\r\n3. tsd install node\r\n\r\nOpen node-0.8.d.ts in VisualStudio 2012 and you should see the error.\r\n\r\nI posted this on StackOverflow, too: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14083427/using-nodejs-with-typescript\r\n\r\nMoreover I had a lenghty conversation with jden in the typescript IRC chatroom, unfortunately he couldn't reproduce the error: http://pastebin.com/yudrhNhg",
