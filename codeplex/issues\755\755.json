    "Description": "When debugging, the debugger steps into all loaded js files which is a pain when landing into JQuery code for example.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to be able to specify on the reference line that the js file associated with the definition file should be bypassed during debugging. \r\n\r\n/// <reference path=\"TypeFiles/jquery.d.ts\" debug=\"no\" />\r\n\r\nOf course, the definition file should contain information so that the debugger could reliably identify the js source file.\r\n\r\n",
