I changed the project file to add support to compile on save of ts files. \r\n\r\nIt seems that the compile on save feature will stop working seemingly at random times and will work other times.",

The solution at that point is to close and re-open the offending file and it starts working again.\n\nThe status bar message is very helpful. Without that compile on save would be unusable.\n\nI wonder if anyone is able to repro the circumstances under which it stops working.",
