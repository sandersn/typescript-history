    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nRandomly when I'm trying to close a typescript file, I get a popup in VS saying that an extension caused an exception and that I should look in the logs. When opening the Activity xml file, I see the following:\r\n\r\n631 ERROR System.NotImplementedException: The method or operation is not implemented. at System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ThrowExceptionForHRInternal(Int32 errorCode, IntPtr errorInfo) at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.KnownBuffersCollection.GetTextLines(Object docData) at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.KnownBuffersCollection.CollectBuffersFromRunningDocumentTable() at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.KnownBuffersCollection.get_Buffers() at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.DefaultScriptContextProvider.RefreshOpenDocumentList(Action callback, Nullable`1 delay, Boolean scriptConfigurationChanged) at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.DefaultScriptContextProvider.OnTextViewClosed(ITextView textView) at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.VsTextViewCreationListener.<>c__DisplayClass2.<VsTextViewCreated>b__1(Object sender, EventArgs e) at Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Utilities.GuardedOperations.RaiseEvent(Object sender, EventHandler eventHandlers)   Editor or Editor Extension 2013/09/20 15:08:19.329 \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSebastien.",
