Now the TypeScript directory is missing and there is no tsc at all.<br />\n<br />\nDoes TypeScript only install if there is a VS2012 or VS2013 on the machine? I'm trying to install the compiler on our build server, which does not have VS2012. I think there might be a bug in the TypeScript setup so that it now only installs the compiler if it also finds VS2012 or VS2013.<br />\n<br />\nI have created a work item for this problem: <a href=\"https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/1649\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/1649</a><br />\n<br />\nRegards,<br />\nMathias<br />\n",
