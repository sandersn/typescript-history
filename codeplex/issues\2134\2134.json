    "Description": "I think it could be better to make this path case insensitive. Currently (0.9.5.0) path for import of AMD modules is case sensitive and it's a bit confusing (especially if Windows system folder structure and URLs are case insensitive).\r\n\r\nLet's say I have the following project structure\r\n\r\n```\r\n| \r\n+-- Services\r\n|       +-- service.ts  \r\n+-- FolderName\r\n        +-- test.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\n__service.ts:__\r\n\r\n```\r\n//This is correct:\r\nimport sth1 = require(\"../FolderName/test\");\r\n\r\n//This is incorrect (Unable to resolve external module)\r\nimport sth2 = require(\"../foldername/test\");\r\n```",
