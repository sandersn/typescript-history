    "Description": "I want to be able to write one module syntax, e.g. import module1 = require(\"./src/module1\") and have it work in both node and the browser without having a dependency on RequireJS or any other AMD loader.\r\n\r\nOne easy way to add support for this is to allow the tsc compiler to bundle the modules into a single file, similar to what Browserify does.",
