    "Description": "\r\n# Observed\r\nThe error\r\n```\r\nType of conditional '{}' must be identical to 'X', 'X' or 'typeof X'.\r\n```\r\nfrom the following (bad) code:\r\n```typescript\r\nenum X {\r\n\tA, B, C\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar s: string;\r\n\r\nvar x = X;\r\n\r\nx =\r\n\ts == \"a\" ? X.A :\r\n\ts == \"b\" ? X.B :\r\n\tX.C;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, while I figured out what I was doing wrong. (should have written ```var x: X ```), the error message was a bit of a red-herring. The condition is of type ```X``` all the way through, never ```typeof X``` (which represents the enum class-object itself).\r\n\r\n# Expected\r\nSame error as with\r\n```typescript\r\nx = X.A;\r\n```\r\nwhich is \r\n```\r\nCannot convert 'X' to 'typeof X'.\r\n```",
