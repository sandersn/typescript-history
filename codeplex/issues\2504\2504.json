    "Description": "I just wanted to notice that I am working on a PSP emulator using typescript without plugins (based on another emulator I made using C#).\r\n174K (256K with tests and definitions) lines of typescript code and growing.\r\n\r\nSource: https://github.com/soywiz/jspspemu (it is possible to try this online here: http://jspspemu.com/)\r\n\r\nI wanted to thank typescript developers for this awesome work. It wouldn't be possible without this. For me, it was very unlikely to try something this big with raw javascript or languages like cofeescript without types and generics. And personally I prefeer typescript over dart, and I think it is more aligned with future standards. So, keep up the good work! :)\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward for the next release with stability and performance improvements.\r\n\r\nIt almost work perfect most of the times (in some rare cases it stop compiling some files and I have to restart the IDE).\r\n\r\nAlso I have files like this:\r\n```\r\nimport _file = require('./manager/file');\r\nexport import Device = _file.Device;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that is currently not working. I have to do this as a hack to get rid of that problem:\r\n```\r\nimport _file = require('./manager/file'); _file.Device;\r\nexport import Device = _file.Device;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is planed to get fixed?\r\n\r\nRegards.",
