They're two different languages. I also find it very odd for a developer to be <em>proud </em>of the fact that he has no knowledge of a certain technology.</p>\r\n<p>That aside, TypeScript is <em>not</em>&nbsp;for you. Knowing JavaScript first is a necessity in order to write TypeScript. If you're waiting for the day when someone creates some magic technology which converts C# and XAML into JavaScript/HTML, you're going to be waiting a long time. There's simply far too many differences between the two development methodologies to make them compatible without a lot of compromises.</p>",
