The two concepts are completely orthogonal, it makes no sense that something should have to be public by virtue of it being static.\r\n\r\nObviously, this would likely be a compile-time only feature, as private is currently.\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/12827544/private-static-properties-in-typescript",
