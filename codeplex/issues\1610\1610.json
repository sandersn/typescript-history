    "ClosedComment": "This is by design. TypeScript 0.9.0 specifically added a feature called declaration merging to enable scenarios like this when it makes sense. It is an error when the module is defined first, but if the class is defined first then the module and class with the same name are merged, essentially allowing the module to define additional static data for the class. You can see the full details in the language specification in section 10.5",
