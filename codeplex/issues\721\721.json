    "Description": "I like to comment closing tags to make my code more readable:\r\n```\r\nmodule Fee {\r\n    class Fi {\r\n        Fo(Fum: number) {\r\n            //Important stuff\r\n        }//End function Fo\r\n    }//End class Fi\r\n}//End module Fee\r\n```\r\nCurrently, TypeScript spits this out as:\r\n```\r\nvar Fee;\r\n    (function (Fee) {\r\n        var Fi = (function () {\r\n            function Fi() { }\r\n            Fi.prototype.Fo = function (Fum) {\r\n            };\r\n            return Fi;\r\n        })();        \r\n        //End function Fo\r\n        //End class Fi\r\n            })(Fee || (Fee = {}));\r\n    //End module Fee\r\n    })(Utility || (Utility = {}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if it could place the closing tag comments in the correct locations in the generated JavaScript.\r\n\r\nThis issue isn't apocalyptic, I just thought I'd bring it up since I noticed you guys have been doing formatting work.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI should mention that the same issue applies for comments on closing braces of `if`, `for`, `while`, `try`, `catch`, anonymous functions, etc.",
