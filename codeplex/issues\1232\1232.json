    "Description": "Hi\r\n\r\nI have implementing a breeze entitymanager factory which is really just written in javascript that I have put into TypeScript. However since TS 0.9 I am now getting the error  The property 'options' does not exist on value of type ''.\r\n\r\n\r\n/// <reference path=\"../typings/breeze/breeze.d.ts\" />\r\n\r\n/*********************************************************\r\n* Factory of EntityManager factories (newEm functions)\r\n*********************************************************/\r\n// Creates newEm(), a typical function for making new EntityManagers (an \"EM factory) \r\n// usage: \r\n//    var serviceName = testFns.northwindServiceName,\r\n//        newEm = testFns.emFactory(serviceName);\r\n//    ...\r\n//    var em = newEm();\r\nexport function newEmFactory(serviceName) {\r\n    var factory = function () {\r\n        return new breeze.EntityManager(factory.options);\r\n    };\r\n    factory.options = {\r\n        serviceName: serviceName,\r\n        // every module gets its own metadataStore; they do not share the default\r\n        metadataStore: new breeze.MetadataStore({ namingConvention: breeze.NamingConvention.camelCase })\r\n     };\r\n    return factory;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what I need to do to make Typescript not generate this error or is this a bug in Typescript",

      "Message": "Where are you getting the breeze.d.ts file from?  Without that file I am unable to reproduce your error.\n\nAlso, if you moved from 0.8.x to 0.9.x, did you also update your breeze.d.ts?  There were a number of breaking changes between these versions, especially for declare files, so any typing you were using prior to 0.9 will likely need to be updated to work with 0.9 releases.",
