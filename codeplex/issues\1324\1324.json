    "Description": "tsc v.9.0.1, copiling to AMD modules, with the following TypeScript:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport app = require('durandal/app');\r\nimport modelmapper = require(\"./modelmapper\");\r\nimport logging = require(\"./logging\");\r\nimport config = require(\"./config\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generated JavaScript is:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndefine([\"require\", \"exports\", 'durandal/app', \"./modelmapper\", \"./logging\"], function(require, exports, __app__, __modelmapper__, __logging__) {    \r\n    var app = __app__;\r\n    var modelmapper = __modelmapper__;\r\n    var logging = __logging__;\r\n    var config = \"./config\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that it sets the config variable to the string \"./config\" and does not add a parameter to the define() function. If I rename config.ts to something else, then it starts working file. It seems to only error when the file is named \"config.ts\".",

      "Message": "I get a compiler error saying that it cant resolve './config' but it still generates that code.\nStrangely, this was happening in 1 project but not another, both with files named 'config.ts' however I did discover that another programmer on the team renamed the file in VisualStudio from 'Config.ts' to 'config.ts', so VS was showing the file as lowercase, but on the file system it was still uppercase. However there were other files being included that had the same scenario but tsc was not having any issue generating code for them. It seems to be an anomaly in just 1 project at the moment.",
