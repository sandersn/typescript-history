      "Message": "The error messages here are not good but your code is invalid. The error you should get on the declaration of f() is \"public function return type has or is using private type 'I'\" because C2 is exported from M but you can use a member of C2 (f) to return a type (I) that isn't itself exported from M. If you export I the error will go away. The 2 declarations of M are further confusing the error reporting. We'll look to clean this experience up.",
