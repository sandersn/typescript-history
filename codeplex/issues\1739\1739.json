    "Description": "I was duped by `@typescript` on Twitter and only just realized that the \"real\" Twitter handle for TypeScript is `@typescriptlang` - whoever is behind that is abusing your logo and misrepresenting your brand.\r\n\r\nI really would love to see that put to an end. I've been saying nice things about TypeScript on Twitter and it looks really bad when you get a smug reply from this imposter, like [this](https://twitter.com/typescript/status/383700958078722049).\r\n\r\nI would love to see this put to an end, but only Microsoft can file a complaint with Twitter...\r\n",
