Currently I couldn't find any way to do that - reference paths to ///MYSDK/decl.d.ts don't work. \r<br />\n<br />\nSince TS is still in its infancy I wouldn't expect that part of the tooling to be immediately available but still, how would you resolve that problem? Are you going to implement this at some point in the TS extension or is this responsibility of VS?\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope this makes sense,\r<br />\nRegards.<br />\n",
