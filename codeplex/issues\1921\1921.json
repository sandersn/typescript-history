      "Message": "This is by design, it has always been an error in the simple cases. There was a bug that was suppressing the error from the underscore typings because of this pattern:\n\n```TypeScript\ndeclare function foo(): any;\ndeclare module foo {\n  export function x(): any; // Remove this line, and the \"Duplicate identifier foo\" error appears\n}\n\ndeclare class foo {\n}\n```\n\nClasses introduce a constructor function with the same name as the class, so now there are 2 functions named _ that conflict. It's not clear how this could possibly work.",
