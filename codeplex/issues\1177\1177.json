    "ClosedComment": "What do you mean by can't debug? Source maps are created by the Typescript compiler to help a debugger map the currently executing JavaScript to it's corresponding Typescript source code. Once you have minified the JavaScript that map no longer makes sense and you would need to debug the minified JavaScript. Please re-open this if I'm misunderstanding or there's some other solution you had in mind.",

    "Description": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nWhen trying to minify and bundle files using for example System.Web.Optimization.BundleTable, I became unable to debug, I looked at the generated js and it cames with \r\n\r\n//@ sourceMappingURL=test.map\r\n\r\nbut still I can not debug it, I jus can debug if I reference de real js in my html page like this\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"Scripts/Model/Product.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"Scripts/ProductsController.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"Scripts/AppView.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nbut this is not good for production mode because it will cause an request for each of js that I am referencing.\r\n\r\nam I missing something ?",
