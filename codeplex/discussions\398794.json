What I expected in such case to see in javascript was a call to\r\n<a title=\"apply\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply\">\r\napply</a>&nbsp;method that would concat&nbsp;1 and elements of arg array as arguments to Method2. Please&nbsp;clarify&nbsp;if my intuition is wrong or this is a bug.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>PS. haw can I call apply method on methods form TS without casting it to any?</p>\r\n",
