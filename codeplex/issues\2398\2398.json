    "Description": "It is really annoying we cannot edit comments on work items.\r\n\r\nSo we spend time typing up some serious bits of feedback on discussion, and in our chase for the perfect text we rework the text a few times. Then (as per Murphy's law) we make some stupid but glaring mistake that made our whole submission look terrible.\r\n\r\nI'm a dedicated github user myself and this is one of those things were you notice codeplex is creaking a little at the egdes. \r\n\r\nIn 2014 we'd expect to be able to edit our comments and fix mistakes and clarify language, especially on a very serious forum like this. How can we reach for quality if the tools don't support it?\r\n\r\n",
