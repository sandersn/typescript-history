    "Description": "class Thing {\n\tpublic member;\n}\n// Type of thingInstance is correctly inferred as \"Thing\":\nvar thingInstance = new Thing;\n\n// Type of thingInstance2 is \"Any\", even though it receives a single assignment of type \"Thing\":\nvar thingInstance2;\nthingInstance2 = new Thing;\n\nSome background:\nThis is a serious limitation for users of Microsoft \"Napa\". For example, when they create a new SharePoint app project, the app template code declares a global \"var context\". That global is assigned inside the sharePointReady() initialization function with a call to \"context = SP.ClientContext.get_current();\". Because it was assigned after it was declared, it isn't recognized as being of type SP.ClientContext, so the user doesn't receive any Intellisense or other benefits of type inference.",
