    "Description": "In the TS editor window, my class/method navigation bar dropdowns are in a state of permanently refreshing. This may be relating to my editor freezing for 20 seconds at a time, quite randomly yet at a frequency of one or two minutes. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, turning off the navigation bar in text editor options - both globally and at the typescript level - has no effect. I have tried both closing the editor window (which once led to a crash - see below) and also restarting VS. Regardless of my settings, the navigation bar persists and remains in a \"(refreshing...)\" state. \r\n\r\nThe call stack in my ActivityLog.xml is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <entry>\r\n    <record>1180</record>\r\n    <time>2013/01/17 17:31:01.210</time>\r\n    <type>Error</type>\r\n    <source>Editor or Editor Extension</source>\r\n    <description>System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x80004005): Unspecified error (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80004005 (E_FAIL))\r\n   at System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ThrowExceptionForHRInternal(Int32 errorCode, IntPtr errorInfo)\r\n   at Microsoft.VisualStudio.ErrorHandler.ThrowOnFailure(Int32 hr)\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.KnownBuffersCollection.GetTextLines(Object docData)\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.KnownBuffersCollection.GetTextBuffer(RunningDocumentInfo docInfo)\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.KnownBuffersCollection.CollectBuffersFromRunningDocumentTable()\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.KnownBuffersCollection.get_Buffers()\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.DefaultScriptContextProvider.RefreshOpenDocumentList(Action callback, Nullable`1 delay)\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.DefaultScriptContextProvider.OnTextViewClosed(ITextView textView)\r\n   at TypeScriptLanguageService.ScriptContext.VsTextViewCreationListener.<>c__DisplayClass2.<VsTextViewCreated>b__1(Object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n   at Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Utilities.GuardedOperations.RaiseEvent(Object sender, EventHandler eventHandlers)</description>\r\n  </entry>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am using Windows 8,  VS 2012 Ultimate/Update 1, ASP.NET 2012.2 RC, Web Essentials 2.3.2 (new today), ReSharper 7.1, TypeScript 0.8.1.1.",

Once I click any variable or other identifier, a dozen or so background tasks get queued up from the TypeScript language service (as shown below.) It will return after twenty or so seconds the first time, but subsequent clicks bump the number of tasks being queued by what seems an order of magnitude. So after about 5 or 6 clicks, it's completely hosed. \n\nI completely uninstalled VS 2012 today, update 1, resharper, SDKs, the whole lot - then deleted my appdata folders for vs11.0, and also killed HKLM/HKCU hives for vs11.0 - overkill probably, but this is f**king ruining my week.\n\n",
