    "Description": "At the moment in lib.d.ts, the static members for built-in types are declared on vars, as in:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeclare var Date: {\r\n    new (): Date;\r\n    new (value: number): Date;\r\n    new (value: string): Date;\r\n    new (year: number, month: number, date?: number, hours?: number, minutes?: number, seconds?: number, ms?: number): Date;\r\n    (): string;\r\n    prototype: Date;\r\n    parse(s: string): number;\r\n    UTC(year: number, month: number, date?: number, hours?: number, minutes?: number, seconds?: number, ms?: number): number;\r\n    now(): number;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis prevents additional d.ts files from augmenting these static interfaces. Case in point, Sugar.js adds a bunch of static methods to the Date type, and there is no way of declaring these.\r\n\r\nInstead, these vars should be declared using interfaces that can be extended, as in:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface DateStatic {\r\n    new (): Date;\r\n    new (value: number): Date;\r\n    new (value: string): Date;\r\n    new (year: number, month: number, date?: number, hours?: number, minutes?: number, seconds?: number, ms?: number): Date;\r\n    (): string;\r\n    prototype: Date;\r\n    parse(s: string): number;\r\n    UTC(year: number, month: number, date?: number, hours?: number, minutes?: number, seconds?: number, ms?: number): number;\r\n    now(): number;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndeclare var Date: DateStatic;\r\n```\r\n",
