      "Message": "TypeScript, like JavaScript, is function scoped.  Any variable (or function) declared inside a function is visible throughout the function (or throughout the entire script if not inside a function - as per your code above).  Thus getDate, endDate, startDate, etc... are all globally available in the code shown above.\n\nUntil ES6 (with the 'let' statement) JavaScript does not have block scoped identifiers.",

      "Message": "OK, so it's by design then and coming from JavaScript. But you would probably agree with me that this is a flawed design and is very prone to undesired code behavior. At least a TypeScript warning in this case would be helpful.",
