    "Description": "When using Visual Studio with ReSharper and TypeScript SDK is installed (via the Visual Studio Extensions for JavaScript), there is always a task shown that's not in the users project:\r\n\r\n__TODO: These are only available in a Web Worker - should be in a separate lib file__\r\n\r\nThis comes out of lib.d.ts when TypeScript SDK is installed - even if it is not used in the users project. I've removed that line manually from the installed file and the task is gone.\r\n\r\nPlease remove that line or maybe even better: fix that todo... ^^\r\n\r\nThanks.",
