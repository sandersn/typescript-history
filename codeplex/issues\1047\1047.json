    "Description": "I'm trying to create documentation using JSDoc with a Typescript based project. When I turned on \"Keep Comments\" in the options, I started seeing server errors such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nServer Error in '/<myapp>' Application.\r\n\r\nReference error in \"~/areas/<somepath>/SomeClass.js\", line 6. Cannot find \"~/App/Classes/SomeOtherClass.ts\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nI noticed the '///<reference path=\"...\">' directives are now being copied over (as they are legitimate comments in JS), and the IIS (8?) compiler is picking them up.",
