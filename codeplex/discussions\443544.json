I was using TypeScript 0.9 in VS 2012 and literally if I changed the module name to &quot;Generics&quot; I got a bunch of compilation errors and when I changed it to &quot;Example&quot; it worked. I tried it five times last night. Today this isn't a problem at all. Kinda glad I started a discussion not an issue, because now I just look mostly stupid rather than completely stupid. Happy days.<br />\n",
