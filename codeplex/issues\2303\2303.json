    "Description": "[https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/854](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/854) seems to have arisen again. It was fixed for 0.9.5, but after installing the 1.0RC, the compile on save feature stops working if an out file is specified. (In my case, this is specified through the .csproj with the <TypeScriptOutFile> node.)\r\n\r\nI have reverted back to 0.9.5 and it works as expected.",

      "Message": "Attached is an example solution where this discrepancy arises.\r\n\r\nThe __TypeScriptHTMLApp1__ project contains 2 .ts files, both of which should compile on save to __test.js__ in the separate, non-typescript __GenericProject__ project. This is set via the _<TypeScriptOutFile>_ in __TypeScriptHTMLApp1.csproj__.\r\n\r\nIn 0.9.5, this all works as expected. Saving either file while working results in the compilation taking place. A full build also works as expected.\r\n\r\nIn 0.9.7 (installed with 1.0RC) however, saving either file results in neither the correct compilation to the single file nor a normal compilation taking place. It appears that the compile on save feature is somehow ignored. A manual build is required to get the desired output.\r\n\r\nHope this clarifies the issue for you.",
