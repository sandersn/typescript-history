<h1>Introduction</h1>
As applications grow from a single source file to multiple source files, you&#39;ll need to allow these source files to see each other&#39;s declarations.  There are three ways that source files can see each other during commandline compilation: if you pass the source files together on the commandline in one call to the compiler, use the &#39;import ... = require(...)&#39; statement, or if you use the ///&lt;reference path=..&quot;&gt;form.  The last of the three, sometimes called &quot;triple slash references&quot;, is a hint to the compiler that source from another file will be available at runtime.  In this article, we&#39;ll focus on triple slash references and how to use them.<br />
