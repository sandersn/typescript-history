    "Description": "Hi, the following snippet\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Base {\r\n    constructor(\r\n        private foo: string\r\n        ) {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nclass Derived extends Base {\r\n    constructor(\r\n        private foo: string\r\n        ) {\r\n        super(foo);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProduces error: TS2141: Class 'Derived' cannot extend class 'Base': Types 'Derived' and 'Base' define property 'foo' as private.\r\n\r\nThis error is reported in the 0.9 MSI installed in Visual Studio, but there is no such error in the playground.\r\n\r\nThis makes it difficult to report any bugs, because they are likely to be closed off as \"not reproducible\".\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to report the following bug associated with this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Derived extends Base {\r\n    constructor(\r\n        foo: string\r\n        ) {\r\n        super(foo);\r\n    }\r\n    public bar() {\r\n        this.foo; // No error accessing private member of base\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or a feature?",

This doesn't have any effect on our ability to repro bugs, the Playground is basically always out of date with our latest bits in develop.\n\nThis issue was fixed yesterday http://vstfdevdiv:8080/DevDiv2/DevDiv/_workItems#id=673585&_a=edit\n\nrepro.ts(14,14): error TS2107: 'Base.foo' is inaccessible.",
