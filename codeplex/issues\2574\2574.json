    "Description": "The sample cannot be run straight out of the box, as _npm install_ resolves [Express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) to 4.x (current latest version), which has breaking changes.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Download [TypeScript zip, of commit 1fd39d1244c01a856432666df8fc87ecb8ea9c48](https://typescript.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/1fd39d1244c01a856432666df8fc87ecb8ea9c48) .\r\n This is the current latest version on master.\r\n2. Extract, go to _/sample/imageboard_\r\n3. Follow _README.txt_\r\n    * All commands finish successfully.\r\n    * _npm install_ finishes successfully, versions are the following:\r\n            ejs @ 1.0.0 node_modules/ejs\r\n            express @ 4.4.4 node_modules/express\r\n            jade @ 1.3.1 node_modules/jade\r\n            mongodb @ 1.4.7 node_modules/mongodb\r\n    * _tsc --module commonjs app.ts_ compiles ok\r\n4. Run _node app.js_\r\n\r\n        /home/stan/typescript/samples/imageboard/app.js:11\r\n        app.configure(function () {\r\n            ^\r\n        TypeError: Object function (req, res, next) {\r\n            app.handle(req, res, next);\r\n          } has no method 'configure'\r\n            at Object.<anonymous> (/home/stan/typescript/samples/imageboard/app.js:11:5)\r\n            at Module._compile (module.js:456:26)\r\n            at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)\r\n            at Module.load (module.js:356:32)\r\n            at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)\r\n            at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10)\r\n            at startup (node.js:119:16)\r\n            at node.js:906:3\r\n\r\nThis is because [app.configure() is removed in Express 4](https://github.com/visionmedia/express/wiki/Migrating-from-3.x-to-4.x#removed-in-express-4).\r\nRemoving Express and _npm install_-ing it with version 3.x fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nThe issue was reproduced on Ubuntu Server 13.10, but I think it will be reproducible on Windows machines as well.",
