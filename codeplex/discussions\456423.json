Now that the JS and MAP files are supposed to be treated as object files, why not just produce them like a regular source file and determine when they are out of date compared to the TS file and compile them as needed?  The preview window from web essentials was cool, but now that it's gone and the project no longer includes the dependent files, it seems meaningless to compile only on save.<br />\n",
