    "Description": "This is a feature request.\r\n\r\nI'd like to have a shorthand for constructing a hash with property-names identical to local variable-names, as this is a common task - example with current syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface User { name: string }\r\n\r\ninterface LoginEvent { user: User }\r\n\r\nfunction onLogin(event: LoginEvent) {\r\n\t// ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar user = { name: \"John\" };\r\n\r\nonLogin({user: user});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to shorten the last line to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nonLogin({user});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would compile into the same code, with the property-name assumed to be `user`, same as the local variable, since nothing else was specified.\r\n",
