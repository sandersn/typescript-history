I'm using the Project properties in Visual Studio under `TypeScript` called `Combine JavaScript output into file`.\r\n\r\nThe issue is; when the `.ts` file is re-compiled, the minified JS doesn't get updated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "Message": "@jamesmw, No; my mistake. the issue is a little more complicated. \n\nSee the thing is; a while back ago  I fixed the Web Essentials part of this issue https://github.com/madskristensen/WebEssentials2013/issues/842. \n\nThere was something wrong with TypeScript project system, which is not triggering our `IFileSaveListener` I am trying to refigure it out. I submitted a technical bug report earlier, but someone from TS team closed it without reading it. So this is a strip down (na√Øve) version of the same. I forgot some details. Now its reviving.\n\nThis is not purely WE bug. There is something which needs updating at TS part. Is it a FileWatcher locking the file or the ProjectItem is not firing the file update event.\n\nI can give you specific (boring) details, but please don't let them close it too. This IS a real bug.",
