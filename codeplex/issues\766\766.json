    "ClosedComment": "Thanks for reporting this\n\nPer the Language Spec (0.8) a static member is a member of the constructor function type. So unlike in C#/VB they are not visible on derived types.\n\nIn order to make them visible they would need to be copied on construction of the extended type or added to the prototype (making them instance members). The challenge with copying is that when modifying the member on the base class, this would not be propagated to the derived class.\n\nA simple solution is to add wrapper members to the Extends class for all members of the Base class you want to expose.",
