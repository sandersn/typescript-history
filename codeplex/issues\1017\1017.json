    "ClosedComment": "It turns out this is actually ok. See section 8.3.2 of the spec:\n\nThe first statement in the body of a constructor must be a super call if both of the following are true:\n•\tThe containing class is a derived class.\n•\tThe constructor declares parameter properties or the containing class declares instance member variables with initializers.\nIn such a required super call, it is a compile-time error for argument expressions to reference this.\n\nSo if for example your Super class had a property with an initializer then you would get a compilation error on the use of 'this' as you expected.",

    "Description": "#Problem:\r\n\r\nWhile typescript disallows this to be used inside a super() constructor expression, it is easy to use this can by trivially wrapping it in a lambda.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere ought to be a test-case for this.  The following code compiles with no errors on current master [ac38ce9] and develop [b0e4da5].\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Base {\r\n\tconstructor(public b: Base) {\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Super extends Base {\r\n\tconstructor() {\r\n\t\tsuper((() => this)());\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI accidentally fixed this in a patch to master for a different issue, but the fix doesn't seem to work on develop (different type checker) or release-9.0 alpha (not sure why).\r\n\r\n#See\r\n\r\nhttps://typescript.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/AdamFreidin/typescript/contribution/4672",
