    "Description": "I'm new to typescript and don't really know how to describe the issue using the correct terms. So I just attached the code and error message here. It should be easy to understand.\r\n\r\n``` TypeScript\r\n// --- Element.ts --- //\r\nclass Element {}\r\nexport = Element;\r\n```\r\n\r\n``` TypeScript\r\n// --- Text.ts --- //\r\nimport Element = require('Element');\r\nclass Text extends Element {}\r\nexport = Text;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen compiling Text.ts with command `tsc --module amd Text.ts`, it produces the following error:\r\n`Text.ts(2,20): error TS2073: A class may only extend another class.`\r\n\r\nThe compiler seems to treat _Element_ as the built-in Element interface instead of the imported class.\r\n\r\nCould anyone confirm if it's a bug or not?",
