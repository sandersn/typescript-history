    "Description": "I have a very odd issue that I can't seem to pin down.  I disabled all extensions, and still there's issues.  The problem is that VS2012 (with IE11) hangs for a LONG time (like literally 2-3 minutes) when an exception is thrown.  Eventually, the error line is correctly shown in the editor, but hitting 'continue' causes another 1-3 min wait if another error is thrown.  I tried debugging VS (with VS ;) ) to see if I can glean some info (pausing the process), but I only see this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tmscorlib.dll!System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAny(System.Threading.WaitHandle[] waitHandles, int millisecondsTimeout, bool exitContext) + 0x92 bytes\t\r\n \tSystem.dll!System.Net.TimerThread.ThreadProc() + 0x347 bytes\t\r\n \tmscorlib.dll!System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart_Context(object state) + 0x6f bytes\t\r\n \tmscorlib.dll!System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunInternal(System.Threading.ExecutionContext executionContext, System.Threading.ContextCallback callback, object state, bool preserveSyncCtx) + 0xa7 bytes\t\r\n \tmscorlib.dll!System.Threading.ExecutionContext.Run(System.Threading.ExecutionContext executionContext, System.Threading.ContextCallback callback, object state, bool preserveSyncCtx) + 0x16 bytes\t\r\n \tmscorlib.dll!System.Threading.ExecutionContext.Run(System.Threading.ExecutionContext executionContext, System.Threading.ContextCallback callback, object state) + 0x41 bytes\t\r\n \tmscorlib.dll!System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart() + 0x44 bytes\t\r\n \t[Native to Managed Transition]\t\r\n```\r\nSeems VS is stuck waiting for something, but I have no idea what - perhaps a response from IE?  Has anyone else experienced something similar?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n_(btw: this has been happening since I can remember - I just put up with and use chrome instead, but debugging with IE+VS can be easier at times ;) )_\r\n",

I noticed that if I set a breakpoint ANYWHERE in the file where line 3 is, this all goes away, so I'm sure something is loaded (symbols?) when a breakpoint is set, otherwise there's a huge lag trying to \"figure it out\".  :/",
