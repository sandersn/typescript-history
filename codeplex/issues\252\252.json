    "Description": "Most of the declarations of methods like getElementsByTagName return a NodeList (of course in the file lib.d.ts). \r\n\r\nBy declaring that it returns a HTMLCollection instead (like also officially stated in the new DOM4 API), helps the typing system in understanding that we talk about Elements and not just any Node.\r\n\r\n-- Peter",
