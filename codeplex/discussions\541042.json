Unfortunately, we are not running VS2012 so I cannot use the Typescript Tools for 2012 package, and we have a policy against upgrading Visual Studio to pre-release versions at my company, so updating to 2013 Update 2 RC is currently out of the question.\r<br />\n<br />\nI downloaded the Node.js package and installed that, but that's a Node package, not an EXE, and we can't require our teams to install Node.js just to build our project. I looked into compiling it with Jake too, but that seems like it only produces the tsc.js file, not a tsc.exe file...\r<br />\n<br />\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!<br />\n",
