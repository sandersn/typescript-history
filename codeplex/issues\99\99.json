    "Description": "I use the jQuery deferred object very often to create custom async promises in my application, ajax api calls, timers, animations, etc. I tried to convert some of my codes to TypeScript, and found that the jQuery.Deferred() constructor is missing from the jquery.d.ts declaration file. So I had to add:\r\n\r\ninterface JQueryStatic {\r\n    Deferred(): JQueryDeferred;\r\n}\r\n\r\nI also had to add a promise() method to the JQueryDeferred type which returns the same Deferred but with the JQueryPromise interface.\r\n\r\ninterface JQueryDeferred {\r\n    promise(target?: any): JQueryPromise;\r\n}\r\n\r\nFor more details see: http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/\r\n\r\nRelated discussion: http://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/398078",
