    "Description": "The following demonstrates a small example of a library defining an object that allows using `+` correctly on variables of this type:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction MyNumber(primitiveNumber) {\r\n    this.wrapped = primitiveNumber;\r\n}\r\n\r\nMyNumber.prototype.valueOf = function () {\r\n    return this.wrapped;\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar x = new MyNumber(3),\r\n    y = new MyNumber(5),\r\n    z = x + y;\r\nconsole.log(z); // 8\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, Typescript currently does not allow this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface MyNumber {\r\n\t(wrapped: number): MyNumber;\r\n\t\r\n\tvalueOf(): number;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar x: MyNumber,\r\n\ty: MyNumber,\r\n\tz = x + y; // Invalid \"+\" expression â€“ types not known to support the addition parameter\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it possible to allow Typescript to recognize that `valueOf` has been overridden to return `number` and infer the correct type (and more importanty, allow an addition)?",
