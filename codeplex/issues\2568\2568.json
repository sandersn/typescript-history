      "Message": "Any TS file I modify in my project and then clear IE temp files and then refresh the page causes the TypeScriptDebugger to crash VS14. I attached the simplest TS file in my project.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue, I just added this line of code after line 17 in the file.... var s = \"\";\r\n\r\nThen I clear the IE temp files so the modified output JS will load in the browser, refresh the browser page and then the TypeScriptDebugger crashes VS14. Like I said I can do this in any TS file and the TS debugger crashes.",

      "Message": "I have figured out exactly how to reproduce this TypeScriptDebugEngine crash 100% of the time. If you create a new TypeScript project using the VS default project template for TypeScript everything runs fine without any VS crashes.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you add an inline script to the HTML page and then refresh the page (you may have to save TS file even though you aren't making changes and then refresh) the TypeScriptDebugEngine crashes VS.\r\n\r\ni.e.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script>\r\n    var s = \"\";\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy just adding the simple inline script above to the HTML page and then refreshing, the TypeScriptDebugEngine crashes. I've tried using a template type script (i.e. <script type=\"text/template\"><span>test</span></script>) and this does NOT cause the TypeScriptDebugEngine to crash.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT...\r\n1. Different from what I said in my original post, you do NOT have to make changes to any TypeScript file for this issue to occur.\r\n2. To reproduce this issue, you may have to refresh the IE browser page a couple times and might even have to save the only TS file and then refresh even though you didn't make any changes.\r\n\r\nThis is especially a problem for WebForm projects, b/c the System.Web.UI.Page class automatically appends inline scripts to the page, which then causes the TypeScriptDebugEngine to crash on page refreshes.\r\n\r\nTo help move this issue along, I have attached the TypeScript project that I am able to reproduce this issue on. There is a index.html and index.aspx and I have the index.aspx set as the startup page. If you debug this project and refresh it works fine, but in the index.aspx page, if you uncomment the inline script I have commented out and then refresh the page, the TypeScriptDebugEngine will crash VS.",
