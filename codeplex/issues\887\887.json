    "Description": "For those of us who are stuck for a while on older platforms,  it would be great if you could add a separate download of the VSIX installer that was available in the 0.8.2 release.  The only thing that prevents TypeScript from being used on my platform is the installer requirements.  I am kind of the evangelist for TypeScript within my company but installation issues limit my ability to convince people to use it.\r\n\r\nSee my workaround install here:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/14510511/how-can-i-install-typescript-with-visual-studio-2010-and-vista",
