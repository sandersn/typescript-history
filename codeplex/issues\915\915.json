    "Description": "Say you wanted to code the following expression: \r\n```\r\nfoo.bar+foo.that\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn C#, you could achieve that with 7 keystrokes:\r\n1. f\r\n2. . (period)\r\n3. b\r\n4. +\r\n5. f\r\n6. .\r\n7. t\r\n\r\n(try that in a C# editor now).\r\n\r\nIn TS as it stands currently, you'll need 11 storkes:\r\n1. f\r\n2. TAB\r\n3. .\r\n4. b\r\n5. TAB\r\n6. +\r\n7. f\r\n8. TAB\r\n9. .\r\n10. t\r\n11. TAB\r\n\r\n(both examples assume no other suggestions are available during completion)\r\n\r\nObviously, C# intellisene is more efficient. I'd like that in TS. Thanks!",

      "Message": "I think this is a breaking issue for many Microsoft developers. I am writing .NET code for almost 10 years, and before .NET I used VB6. These environments give you the ultimate comfort while typing. After using these environments and knowing that all technologies are ready in 2013 at the top software development research company, I find it really annoying when I type a symbol and I do not get completion, only the symbol:\nwi.\nwindow.doc.\nwindow.document.wr(\n...\nThis is one of the things I love Visual Studio and hate other development environments, the experience of writing source code.",
