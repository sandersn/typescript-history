You can really only shave a few bytes off the code by using ES5, and the added complexity didn't justify the cost. It turns out to be rather tricky because you have to have the two implementations be 100% identical in every aspect, behavior-wise, if you don't want to create some very nasty problems at runtime.<br />\n",
