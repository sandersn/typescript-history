    "Description": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nIs there a way to get the JSDoc help to appear in Visual Studio when coding? TypeScript is showing us the method signatures just fine, but we carefully document all of our core classes and they appear to just be ignored at the moment.\r\n\r\nThis is just while editing. I've worked out how to export the comments to our js files on build, but we really want to see those comments during coding in the help pop-ups that appear already but seem limited just to data types.\r\n\r\nOn a similar note can VS not yet auto-generated documentation for TypeScript files? I mean at edit time, inside the IDE. In a C# app you start off the comment block and it auto-fills it all ready for you to edit. But that doesn't appear to work for ts files.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nRich",
