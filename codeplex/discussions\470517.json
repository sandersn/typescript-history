Save it locally and open again, and the state is preserved.<br />\n<br />\nThere are quite a few bugs and limitations in this early prototype, my laser focus is to make it good enough to host its own development inside itself. After that I will get the code to a good shape, add unit tests and stuff. It's quite a dirty quick code at the moment.<br />\n<br />\nOh by the way, it works on quite a broad range of browsers. Even on a old crappy Blackberry I have lying around.<br />\n",
