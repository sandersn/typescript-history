    "Description": "The sourcemap generator assumes the .js and js.map files will be emitted next to their .ts source file, even though it's possible to emit the .js to another directory. I see the `fullSourceMapPath` parameter in the source of tsc.ts. Even though it's experimental I was hopeful but it doesn't work as expected:\r\n\r\nMy setup: I have a .ts file that will throw an error in my work directory and compile it to another folder.\r\n\r\nAs expected this doesn't allow debugging with only the `sourcemap` parameter because the references to the .ts file in the .js.map is not correct. \r\n\r\nSo I used the `fullSourceMapPath` parameter but still it's not working: it _does_ expand two paths (in the `@ sourceMappingURL` in the .js and the `file` in the sourcemap), but it skips the path in the `sources` field in the .js.map's json structure.\r\n\r\nedit: this is on windows using the release version of TypeScript from npm, both commandline as in `grunt-typescript` (a fork I was adding support for this feature to).",
