    "Description": "Calling `tsc file.js` when `file.js` does exist in the correct location causes `tsc` to throw an error.\r\n\r\nError reading file \"file.js\": File not found\r\n\r\nThis is misleading since \"file.js\" actually does exist in the expected location. It appears that `tsc` only accepts input files that have the `.ts` extension. The error should be changed to state the actual problem.",
