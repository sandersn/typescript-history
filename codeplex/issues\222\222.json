    "Description": "I organized my .ts source files in subdirectories relative to the project root. However, the source map generated by tsc only lists the filenames, not the relative paths. So when I try to use the source map in a browser, I get 404 error messages because the browser looks for the files in the root directory instead of the respective subdirectories.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\ncommon.ts\r\nmodule1/module1.ts\r\nmodule2/module2.ts\r\n\r\ncompiled into project.ts.\r\n\r\nproject.ts.map lists them as:\r\n\r\n\"sources\":[\"common.ts\",\"module1.ts\",\"module2.ts\"],",
