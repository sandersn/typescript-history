    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\n__Version 0.9.5 Beta__\r\n\r\nConsider the following:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\ninterface Promise<T> {\r\n\r\n    then<U>(value: T): void;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Bar {\r\n\r\n    bar(value: \"Menu\"): Promise<string>;\r\n\r\n    bar<T>(value: string, element: string): Promise<T>;\r\n\r\n    bar<T>(value: string): Promise<T>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to [a closed issue](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/1918) the first bar method on interface Bar should generate a TS2154: \"Specialized overload signature is not subtype of any non-specialized signature\". However, the code compiles without error.\r\n\r\nA few further observations.\r\n`\r\n1.  When the file containing the code above is saved (in VS) the status bar displays \"Input files(s) contained syntax errors. Output generation skipped.\". However, as mentioned the project itself compiles without error.\r\n2. There is no red squiggly line.\r\n3. The red squiggly line appears and the project fails to compile under the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n(a). The <U> is removed from the \"then\" method.\r\n(b). Either the second or the third \"bar\" method is commented out.\r\n",
