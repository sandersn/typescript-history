    "Description": "Seems that array.concat only allows arrays as parameters according to the declaration in lib.d.ts. \r\n\r\nI believe this is however not correct. There is also behavior defined for other types of objects like plain objects,  strings and numbers as parameters. So the lib.d.ts definition should be less strict.\r\n\r\n",
