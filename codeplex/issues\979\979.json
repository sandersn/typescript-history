    "Description": "I am editing a typescript file moving the text pointer around the text. I expect that when I hit Ctrl + \"-\", which is a standard shortcut for the View.NavigatreBackward command, the Vistual Studio gets me to the previous position where I edited the code (as it works in C#). In TypeScript I get to the previous edited file despite the fact there are places in the current file I stopped at. I wish the experience was the same as in C#.\r\n\r\nSeen in 0.8.3 as well as 0.9.",
