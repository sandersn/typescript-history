    "Html": "I have a jquery.random.d.ts file that hold all of my little jQuery extension interfaces. Obviously, they have to augment either the JQuery or the JQueryStatic interface. They work fine 99% of the time, but I ran into a small issue, and I'm not sure if it's a bug or intentional. Here's my code:<br />\n<pre><code>$.base64.encode(...); //works fine here\n$.fancybox({\n    onComplete: function() {\n        $.base64.decode(...); //isn't part of interface here\n    }\n});</code></pre>\n\nAs you can see, I call the jQuery fancybox function in my code (actually inside a private method of a class). It works just fine, and all of my jQuery extensions show up just fine. But when I'm inside the callback function in the code, none of the extensions show up. Only the members from jquery.d.ts show up, none of the ones from any of my files.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've been searching for about 30 minutes with no luck. Have I run into a bug?<br />\n",
