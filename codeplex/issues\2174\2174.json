    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe have this particular use-case. \r\n\r\nSay we have two projects: MyLib.csproj and MyClient.csproj.\r\n\r\nFor each project we'd like to\r\n\r\n* Generate a single declarations file and have it created in the bin directory, e.g. MyLib.d.ts\r\n* Redirect all JavaScript output to the bin directory.\r\n* Not have the JavaScript files combined, instead we have a matching .js file for each .ts file.\r\n\r\nThis would enable the following\r\n\r\n* The ability to reference types in another project using a single <reference> include, \r\ne.g. \r\n```XML\r\n<reference path=\"MyLib.d.ts\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n* The ability to debug JavaScript files individually in the browser.\r\n\r\nAt present the \"Combine JavaScript output into file\" option combines both the JavaScript _and_ the declarations file.\r\n\r\nI suggest another check box for \"Combine declarations output into file\".\r\n\r\nThanks.",
