    "Description": "Basically I would like to have better type inference for indexers. I already described issue here:\r\nhttps://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/2391\r\nbut since this would be a breaking change.\r\nI suggest that this behaviour should be opt-in. Something like \"inferIndexer\" switch that could be easily passed when compiling. This option would probably be most used with \"noImplicitAny\" because then we don't have any breaking change to existing code and stil have better type inference and type safety.",
