Do you have any suggestions? Or are you even interested in providing packages or help developing it?\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://visto.codeplex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">visto.codeplex.com</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nMore detailed description: \r<br />\nVisto JavaScript Library integrates KnockoutJS, JQuery and RequireJS (and TypeScript) to provide the programming model known from .NET XAML and MVVM: It is possible to implement views with &quot;code-behind&quot; and bindings to view models, declaratively load sub views from the view's HTML and navigate between pages - all in a single-page application. <br />\n",
