    "Description": "Respected community members,\r\n            I have tried installing TypeScript from TypeScriptLang.org website, 3- 4 times now, but every time I install it says install correctly, but when I open VS 2012 , it thorws an error and never opened. I had to reinstall vs 2012 one time.\r\n\r\ncan some one point out why TypeScript installation corrupt vs 2012????\r\n\r\nAlso there is no contact us or About us on TypeScriptLang.org for reporting this kind of issues.. or at least they should redirect to codeplex, isn't it??\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNick ",
