If you look at the spec ( http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-HTML/html.html#ID-6986576 ) both of these methods are defined as returning HTMLElement.\n\nThat said, I agree this is suboptimal from a typing perspective if the methods will always return the more specialized element type.  I'm going to mark this for consideration and talk with the team on the best course of action here.\n\nThanks for raising!",
