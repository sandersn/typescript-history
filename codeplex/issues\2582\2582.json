This is just the DefinitelyTyped package for Knockout. That combined with the fact that it successfully builds all of my TypeScript when I just build it, leads me to believe that the problem isn't actually in my TypeScript. I think the TypeScript compiler used to have a bug which caused this behavior before 0.9.5. But the path of tsc.exe indicates that the compiler is version 1.0.\r\n\r\nHere's some information about the MSBuild target that's failing. The actual target I'm building is defined like this:\r\n\r\n      <Target Name=\"WebPackage\" DependsOnTargets=\"CalculateWebApps\">\r\n        <!-- Add steps to delete the \\dist directory and re-create it just in case. -->\r\n        <RemoveDir Directories=\"%(WebApp.ProjectPath)dist\" Condition=\"Exists('%(WebApp.ProjectPath)dist')\" />\r\n        <MakeDir   Directories=\"%(WebApp.ProjectPath)dist\"/>\r\n        <MSBuild  Projects=\"%(WebApp.ProjectFile)\" Targets=\"Package\" />\r\n      </Target>\r\n\r\nThe WebApp project imports the Microsoft.WebApplication.targets, from Microsoft\r\n\r\n      // Somewhere in %(WebApp.ProjectFile)\r\n      <Import Project=\"$(VSToolsPath)\\WebApplications\\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets\" Condition=\"'$(VSToolsPath)' != ''\" />\r\n\r\nWhich in turn imports publishing targets, including Package.\r\n\r\n    // Somewhere in Microsoft.WebApplication.targets\r\n    <Import Project=\"..\\Web\\Microsoft.Web.Publishing.targets\" Condition=\"Exists('..\\Web\\Microsoft.Web.Publishing.targets')\" />\r\n",

      "Message": "I figured it out.\n\nFirst of all, CompileTypeScript was never called in my build script. This was due to a faulty import of my TypeScript targets. Essentially, I needed to import the targets at the bottom of my project file, after declaring all of my TypeScriptCompile arguments.\n\nAfter I did that, I found that my build target started breaking in the same way as my package target, and tracked it down to an extension to KnockoutComputed interface which was getting compiled first, and which caused the subsequent DefinitelyTyped file to be invalid.\n\nSo, it was just a bug in my project's TypeScript.\n\n",
