    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe have been using TypeScript for a while now in VS2012. We recently started to migrate to VS2013 and are almost finished. Now we discover that the implementation of TypeScript in VS2013 does not generate the JavaScript on save anymore although I have the 'Automatically compile TypeScript files which are part of a project' switched on.\r\n\r\nInstalled programs:\r\n\r\nVS2013 Professional on Windows 7\r\nTypescript 0.9.1.1 version for VS2012 and VS2013\r\nVisualSVN 4.0\r\nTangible T4 Editor 2.2.0\r\nVisual Studio 12 Editor Extension 1.0\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nPaul Sinnema",
