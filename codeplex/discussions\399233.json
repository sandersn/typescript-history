It must've been lots of work. \r<br />\n<br />\nAs an exercise I've ported a project of mine from JS to TypeScript but I run into a problem with box2dweb. My TypeScript compiles without any problems but when I run the code I get the following message: Uncaught ReferenceError: b2Dynamics is not defined.\r<br />\n<br />\nI am not quite sure how to fix this and I was hoping you could give me some pointers.<br />\n",
