    "Description": "In Visual Studio, when working with C# or C++ code, class names are highlighted with light blue, which makes the code much better to read and faster to understand. It would be nice if the TypeScript syntax highlighter could do the same for class, enum and interface names. I think this shouldn't take too much time to implement, since IntelliSense recognizes these symbols perfectly.\r\n\r\nMaybe the enum values could be colored too as it's seen on the attached image.\r\n\r\nI didn't find a Visual Studio-specific issue tracker for TypeScript, so I hope I wrote this feature request in the right place.",
