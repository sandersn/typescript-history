    "Html": "Mr. Anders Hejlsberg if you think that language without static typing classes or interfaces is not good language to write and enterprise applications, talk to guys who write in Erlang... or some other functional language. if you did not know, JavaScript is dynamically typed and functional language... in that kind of language you have other ways to achieve goals then in C# for example. you do not structure the code like in C# or other OO language, you do not need classes and member visibility because you have closures, you do not have to have interfaces, because you have dynamic typing, and guess what, you do not need it all, because when you pick JavaScript you do not want to have these things, and if you do, well pick C#.\r<br />\nThe purpose of having many languages is simple, you can pick different tools to different tasks. if you want to transform JavaScript into C# or Java... well good luck:)<br />\n",
