    "Description": "JSDocs are not being correctly applied to autogenerated properties.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n``` TypeScript\r\n/**\r\n * Four legged animal.\r\n */\r\nclass Dog {\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * Creates a Dog.\r\n\t * @param name The name of the Dog.\r\n\t */\r\n\tconstructor(public name: string){}\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar a = new Dog('rover');\r\na.name = ...\r\n```\r\nYou'd expect when assigning to `name` or mousing over it, that Intellisense would tell give you the same description as applied via the `param` tag on the constructor. This is the only feasible way to get JSDoc Intellisense on autogened properties, so I hope this issue is tackled at some point.\r\n\r\n[Playground reproduction](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground/#src=%2F**%0A%20*%20Four%20legged%20animal.%0A%20*%2F%0Aclass%20Dog%20%7B%0A%09%2F**%0A%09%20*%20Creates%20a%20Dog.%0A%09%20*%20%40param%20name%20The%20name%20of%20the%20Dog.%0A%09%20*%2F%0A%09constructor(public%20name%3A%20string)%7B%7D%0A%7D%0A%0Avar%20a%20%3D%20new%20Dog('rover')%3B%0Aa.name)",
