    "Description": "Consider this case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmyFunction(len: number) {\r\n    var len: number = 5;     // re-definition of local variable (name clash)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand that EcmaScript allows local variables to be redefined, so it's not an option to flag this as an error in TypeScript.\r\n\r\nIt would however be great if the TypeScript compiler just generates a warning for such a case.\r\n\r\nAnother case would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmyFunction() {\r\n    var b: number = a;       // variable a is accessed before it is declared/initialized\r\n    var a: number = 5;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a consequence of variable hoisting in EcmaScript. Here too, a warning would be great.",
