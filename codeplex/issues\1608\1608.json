    "Description": "As of WebEssentials 3.0 the custom regions ```\\\\#region MyRegion ... \\\\#endregion``` no longer collapse in the VS 2012 editor. This is likely due to all TypeScript support being removed from WE 3.0. Also the TS editor in the VS 2013 Preview TypeScript tooling also does not seem to have this feature.\r\n\r\nPlease add collapsible custom region support to the TypeScript editor tooling.",
