Does the project build on the command line (indicating the leak is in some language service operation rather than a type check phase)? Please re-open with whatever you can provide to help us diagnose this further.",

    "Description": "I updated to the new 0.9.1.1 compiler and now as soon as I open one TS file in Visual Studio it starts consuming massive amounts of memory. It usually levels off around 3 GB, but then if you try any other operation in Visual Studio it crashes. Even if you open the file and immediately close it, it still continues to consume memory. I never saw the memory leak issue that other saw in 0.9.1, but I now see it in 0.9.1.1.",
