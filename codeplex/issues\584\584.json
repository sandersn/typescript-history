    "Description": "I'm trying to add typing to some internal JSON objects I'm creating. Although I'm allowed to type the variables I want, intellisense doesn't seem to be working on them.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nvar myObj : MyInterface = \r\n{\r\n internalFn: function()\r\n {\r\n   var test : AnotherInterface = blah;\r\n   test. <== only members within the JSON object come up, not members defined in \"AnotherInterface\"\r\n }\r\n};\r\n\r\nThis is a high priority issue for my company's product as we rely heavily on the ability to create internal constructs within JSON.",
