    "Description": "\r\nI have read other posts that indicated that using .map files from non-TypeScript compiler-generated sources will cause this error.  I have deleted every .map file from my solution and it still crashes VS quite often.  Is there any way to disable the TypeScriptDebugEngine?  I don't think it's needed if I'm not using .map files anyways.\r\n\r\n\tApplication: devenv.exe\r\n\tFramework Version: v4.0.30319\r\n\tDescription: The process was terminated due to an unhandled exception.\r\n\tException Info: System.NullReferenceException\r\n\tStack:\r\n\t   at TypeScriptDebugEngine.SourceMapReader.GetSourceMapFileName(Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Script.DkmScriptDocument)\r\n\t   at TypeScriptDebugEngine.DebugMonitor.Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.ComponentInterfaces.IDkmScriptDocumentContentInsertNotification.OnScriptDocumentContentInsert(Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Script.DkmScriptDocument, Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.Symbols.DkmTextSpan, System.String, Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.DkmEventDescriptor)\r\n\t   at Microsoft.VisualStudio.Debugger.EntryPoint.IDkmScriptDocumentContentInsertNotification_OnScriptDocumentContentInsert(IntPtr, IntPtr, IntPtr, IntPtr, IntPtr)\r\n",
