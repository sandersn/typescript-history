    "Description": "Hi, \r\n\r\nThe code is spread across three files in the repro below. In the code we have, \"File 2\" and \"File 3\" are in the same project while \"File 1\" is in a separate project. Each file has a common <reference> include, which is omitted in the code below.\r\n\r\nThis is a tricky problem to debug, because the file with the actual problem \"File 1\" compiles fine, while the compiler fails on \"File 3\", which doesn't seem to have an obvious problem.\r\n\r\n// File 1\r\nmodule my.interfaces {\r\n\r\nexport interface IFace1 {}  \r\n\r\nexport interface IFace2 {\r\n\t\r\n\tgetFace: IFace1; // The problem\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n// File 2\r\nmodule my.classes {\r\n\t\r\n\texport class F1 implements interfaces.IFace1{\r\n\t\t\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n// File 3\r\nmodule my.classes {\r\n\t\r\n\texport class F2 implements interfaces.IFace2 {\r\n\t\t// Compiler error \"The name 'IFace1' does not exist in the current scope\"\r\n\t\tpublic getFace = new F1(); \r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nTo fix the compilation error we need to amend the IFace2 declaration in \"File 1\" to the following:\r\n\r\nexport interface IFace2 {\r\n\t\r\n\tgetFace: interfaces.IFace1;\r\n}\r\n\r\n",
