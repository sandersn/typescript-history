    "Description": "In v0.9 you've removed semicolons support after methods ('No longer accept semicolon at the end of methods'). I propose you to do the same for classes, enums, interfaces and modules. Now compiler doesn't complain about semicolon in those places and generate an empty line with semicolon which is pretty useless I think.",
