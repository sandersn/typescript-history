    "Description": "This is with 0.9.5.  There is a coloring bug in VS that could lead to some confusion when creating interfaces.  Please consider the code below.\r\n\r\nIf \"implicit any\" is allowed, the below code compiles fine.  However, each of the arguments on the DoStuff function are of type \"any\", even though visual Studio highlights them in blue implying that they are a specific type.  The tooltips in VS and the use of the interfaces otherwise work correctly and show that the parameters are named \"number\", \"string\", and \"boolean\" and are of type Any.\r\n\r\nBecause of the coloring issue, a developer (me) could be fooled into thinking that they are doing the right thing by not naming the parameters on the function and that \"just specifying the type\" was sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface ITest1 {\r\n    DoStuff(number): string; //\"number\" should not be blue?\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface ITest2 {\r\n    DoStuff: (number) => string;  //\"number\" should not be blue?\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface ITest3 {\r\n    DoStuff: (string) => string;   // first \"string\" should not be blue?\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface ITest4 {\r\n    DoStuff: (boolean) => string;  //\"boolean\" should not be blue?\r\n}\r\n```",
