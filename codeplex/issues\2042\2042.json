    "Description": "The grammar in the spec implies that once you've introduced a constant enum value into an enum declaration, you can't specify another computed enum value. The compile also give an error. But the specification has the following example (which errors in the current compiler):\r\n\r\nenum Test {     A,     B,     C = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000),     D = 10,     E } \r\n\r\nThe sample should be fixed and the spec should ideally be made more clear about this.",
