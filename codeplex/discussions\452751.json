    "Html": "To get source maps, the project file you're using needs to pass in the source map enabling flags to the compiler.  You can get to these by starting a new HTML5 project in VS, unloading the project and editing.  You'll see under the debug build type that it will enable source maps.  For your projects, you'd need to pass then when doing the compile.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnother common issue we're seeing is that the source maps are generated, but we link to them using the new //# source link style at the end of the .js rather than the old //@, so some versions of Chrome can't read them.  Not sure if this is related, but handy to know when you're doing source maps.<br />\n",
