    "ClosedComment": "We'll need more info to act on this, as breakpoints certainly work in the general case, there must be something specific you're doing to hit this issue. What version of TypeScript are you using? What version of Windows? What type of VS project? What's the code snippet where you're seeing this? Please re-open this bug if you can provide info to help us narrow down the issue here.",
