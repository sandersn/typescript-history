    "Description": "An object initialiser can contain multiple definitions for the same property with a different type signature.\r\n\r\n    interface Thing {\r\n        thunk: (str: string) => void;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function test(thing: Thing) {\r\n        thing.thunk(\"str\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    test({\r\n        thunk: (str: string) => {\r\n            console.log('string: ' + str)\r\n        },\r\n        thunk: (num: number) => {\r\n            console.log('number: ' + num)\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nThis passes the type checker because it takes the type signature of the first thunk property. However, according to section 11.1.5 (Object Initialiser) of Ecma 262 it is the last assignment to thunk that should be the final value of the property.\r\n\r\nThis means a string can be passed into thunk while the type checker thinks it can only be passed a number.",
