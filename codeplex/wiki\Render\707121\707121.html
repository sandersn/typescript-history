<div class="wikidoc"><h1>To Build TypeScript</h1><ol><li>Install Node if you havenâ€™t already (http://nodejs.org/)</li>
<li>Install Jake, the tool we use to build our compiler (https://github.com/mde/jake). To do this, run &quot;npm install -g jake&quot;.</li>
<li>To use jake, run one of the following commands in the directory with your clone of the git repo: 
<ul><li>jake local - This builds the compiler. The output is in built/local in the public directory </li>
<li>jake clean - deletes the build compiler </li>
<li>jake LKG - This replaces the LKG (last known good) version of the compiler with the built one. This is a bootstrapping step to be executed whenever the built compiler reaches a stable state.</li>
<li>jake tests - This builds the test infrastructure, using the built compiler. </li>
<li>jake runtests - This runs the tests, using the built compiler and built test infrastructure. You can also override the host or specify a test for this command. Use host=&lt;hostName&gt; or test=&lt;testPath&gt;. </li>
<li>jake baseline-accept - This replaces the baseline test results with the results obtained from jake runtests. </li>
<li>jake -T lists the above commands. </li></ul></li></ol>
