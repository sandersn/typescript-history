    "Description": "Now that TypeScript provides construct and tooling for developing more easily in javascript, I think that it would be great to provide a way in svcutil.exe to generate client code or proxy classes in TypeScript given a wsdl.\r\n\r\nProbably an extra logic to map JSON to and from these proxy classes (especially when Silverlight is going out of the picture)",
