    "Description": "In TypeScript 0.9.5 beta, the following code in the root of a module fails with error “TS2108: 'this' cannot be referenced within module bodies.” on the lines where `this` is referenced:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar foo = {\r\n\t_foo: '1',\r\n\tget foo():string {\r\n\t\treturn this._foo;\r\n\t},\r\n\tset foo(value:string) {\r\n\t\tthis._foo = value;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlacing the same code within a function declaration does not fail. This code worked in 0.9.1.",

We're investigating, but in the meantime you should be able to workaround the issue by returning the object from an immediately invoked function (not super elegant, but it does mean the object literal is within a function, not at the top level in a module).\n\n```\nvar foo = function () {\n        return {\n            _foo: '1',\n            get foo(): string {\n                return this._foo;\n            },\n            set foo(value: string) {\n                this._foo = value;\n            }\n        };\n    } ();\n```",
