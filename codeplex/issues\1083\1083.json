    "ClosedComment": "On the latest bits the redeclaration of 'name' complains with these errors:\n\n-Duplicate identifier 'name'.\n-Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type.  Variable 'name' must be of type 'A', but here has type 'B'\n\nwhich is the intended behavior. JavaScript hoists the variable declarations within a scope so the 'name' in each branch of the if/else refer to the same variable. Thus, you must have them be of the same type. Strictly speaking, it could always be an error to redeclare a variable as you've done in the else branch, but we found the number of errors that introduces to user code to be undesirable given that most of the time the variable had the same type in each branch. So you are allowed to redeclare a variable of the same name as long as the type matches exactly.",
