(based on all the files you currently have in your project and/or maybe solution???...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo say MyClassA.ts looks like:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>module MyModule{\r\n  <span style=\"color:blue\">export</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">class</span> MyClassA {}\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And my MyClassB.ts looks like:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>module MyModule{\r\n  <span style=\"color:blue\">export</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">class</span> MyClassB {\r\n    myClassAField: MyClassA = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> MyClassA();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Around &quot;MyClassA&quot; a&nbsp;suggestion&nbsp;would show to either import or reference the other file...<br>\r\nHowever... I am not sure how the exact function of it should work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this already exists in a plugin somewhere please direct me :)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso in the long run, how the ecosystem should be, i mean if it should logically mimic the eco system of so many other tools... so you could make a &quot;TypeScript&quot; project, wherein all ts files would be packaged to a single .js file for output...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr if that would break apart how we work with JS... I Mean untill now I have always had them within my main web solution or similar... So as &quot;Secondary&quot; solution items to the .NET Assembly output and web pages... But if I where to develop a large scale JS app,\r\n I might begin to consider packaging it more like I am use to with other projects...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could also mean we could look at optimizing the code within that &quot;module&quot;...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, this is properly not something to put around the corner, and I have no idea how relevant this could be to other IDE's as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If there is a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;project for the VS plugin and I am posting this in the wrong place, I&nbsp;apologize)&nbsp;\r\n<p></p>\r\n",
