      "Message": "Hi, you are right in that if the code I provided is pasted into the Playground or a new file the error does not occur.\n\nIt appears that the error occurs when there are <reference> includes to other code files.\n\nI've been able reproduce this by adding references to a newly created .ts file holding the code above. \n\nIf the error does not immediately occur try the following:\n\n - Edit a reference path to make the path invalid\n - Wait until the red squiggly line appears in the path\n- Edit the reference path again to make it valid\n- Now the red squiggly line under the path disappears, but error I reported above appears\n\nIt's all rather strange. There was nothing special in the referenced files that could have caused a problem; they were all compiling fine.\n\nLet me know if I can help further.\n\nNoel",
