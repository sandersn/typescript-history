    "Description": "According to specification for interfaces:\r\n1. A call signature declaration hides a base type call signature that is identical when return types are ignored.\r\n2. The instance type (section 3.5.3) of the declared interface must be a subtype (section 3.8.2) of each of the base type references.\r\n\r\nBut in the example below compiler gives no error even though IDerivedMethod is not a subtype of IBaseMethod (its call signature return type is not a subtype of base call signature return type, because it doesn't have \"Red1\" property).\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface IBaseMethod {\r\n  (p: {Tomato}): {Red1};\r\n }\r\n\r\ninterface IDerivedMethod extends IBaseMethod {\r\n  (p: {Tomato}): {Red; Tasty};\r\n}\r\n```",
