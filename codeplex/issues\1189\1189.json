      "Message": "I'm a bit baffled.  In trying to diagnose this further, I started with devenv.exe /log in admin mode ( I normally run in admin mode) and it started working.   I closed and restarted again and it remains working.   I also had a ton of issues with parsing the jquery.d.ts file, but removed that to attempt to isolate this problem.  Now I have added the jquery.d.ts reference back and I am not getting any errors with it.  \n\nI kind of wonder if there was some sort of cache that was cleared by using the /log switch.\n\nI have to say a big thank you for the automatic check out of both the source and generated .js file working in 0.9",

Removing any more parts from this snippet gets rid of the error.",
