After re-installing the 0.9.0.1 VS2012 extension and rebooting Windows, all TypeScript features were visible in the VS2013 Preview.\n\nCan you please update the [extension download section](http://www.typescriptlang.org/#Download) and [page](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34790) with some extra text pointing out that the VS2012 extension also works for the VS2013 Preview?
