    "Description": "On updating to 0.9.1 I'm now running into an issue where some of my generic classes aren't picking up extension methods to common classes such as Number.\r\n\r\nI've attempted a minimal repro of the issue but i've been unable to reproduce it minimally.\r\n\r\nI've pushed a branch that replicates this issue (along side other issues when updating) to my project: https://github.com/NTaylorMullen/EndGate/tree/TSError\r\n\r\nTo show a quick sample of what's going wrong:\r\n\r\nI have an interface:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport interface ICloneable {\r\n    Clone(): any;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is used to extend the Number prototype:\r\n```\r\n/// <reference path=\"../Interfaces/ICloneable.ts\" />\r\n\r\ninterface Number extends EndGate.ICloneable {}\r\n\r\nNumber.prototype.Clone = function (): any { return this; };\r\n```\r\n\r\nA [Tween class](https://github.com/NTaylorMullen/EndGate/blob/TSError/EndGate/EndGate.Core.JS/Tweening/Tween.ts):\r\n```\r\nexport class Tween<T extends ICloneable> implements IUpdateable {\r\n....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Another class that derives from it](https://github.com/NTaylorMullen/EndGate/blob/TSError/EndGate/EndGate.Core.JS/Tweening/NumberTween.ts):\r\n```\r\nexport class NumberTween extends Tween<number> {\r\n....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe derived NumberTween class has several errors associated with extending Tween<number> because it's not recognizing \"number\" as ICloneable.  This of course can be fixed by changing everything to Number which shouldn't have to be done.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind I was unable to minimally repro this, hence why I pushed a branch.",
