    "Description": "From: https://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/546459\r\n\r\nHello: At TSLint, we have a rule to detect unused imports. We do that by calling into LanguageService's getReferencesAtPosition for all import variables and counting the number of references. This works fine in 0.9.7, but it's broken in 1.0. For example, consider the snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport $ = require(\"jquery\");\r\n$(\"a\");\r\n```\r\ngetReferencesAtPosition previously returned 2 for the position 7 (where $ is defined) and now just 1. This appears to be a regression that now puts the \"unused imports\" rule at risk, and I'm hesitant to upgrade the linter to use 1.0. Can someone please look into this? Thanks!",
