Some of these .d.ts files are code generated from a C# library, others are defined in my TS project. I then compile them all into one .d.ts file for consumption. However with the release of TS 1.0 I am getting 'Duplicate Identifier' errors on build because the compiled .d.ts and the original .d.ts files live within the same folder structure. Any thoughts on how to work around this issue?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\ncsnance<br />\n",
