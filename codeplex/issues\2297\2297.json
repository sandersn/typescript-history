    "Description": "Say we have the JS structure: \r\n```\r\nts\r\n    a.ts\r\n    foo\r\n    |    b.ts\r\n    |    c.ts\r\njs\r\n    a.js\r\n    foo\r\n    |    b.js\r\n    |    c.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we compile with all three files with outDir `js` its all okay. But if we only compile `b.ts` or `c.ts` with outDir set to js then we would get: \r\n```\r\njs    \r\n    |    b.js\r\n    |    c.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nReference : https://github.com/grunt-ts/grunt-ts/issues/77",
