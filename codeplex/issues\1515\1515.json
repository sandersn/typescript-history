Using the latest bits 0.9.1.1 I'm not able to reproduce this issue, both when editing the knockout.d.ts file and when consuming that file in a different file, IntelliSense is near instant for me.\n\nIf you have some more info, which would help us reproduce this issue, please re-open this bug using the button on top.",

    "Description": "I'm noticing some performance issues when using the knockout.d.ts file located here: https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/DefinitelyTyped/blob/knockoutamd/knockout/knockout.d.ts\r\n\r\nIt uses a pattern where it can be consumed using both AMD and static file loading, so has the following declarations at the end of the file:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndeclare module \"knockout\" {\r\n\texport = ko;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndeclare var ko: KnockoutStatic;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm noticing it's taking a really long time to load Intellisense suggestions in both VS2012 and VS2013 at every invocation, not just at first loading of the file.\r\n\r\nI have not had the same performance issues with the file in the following branch without the AMD module declaration:\r\nhttps://github.com/AndrewGaspar/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/knockout/knockout.d.ts",

I'm having problems in this branch where the KnockoutStatic interface is replaced with a module called ko:\nhttps://github.com/AndrewGaspar/DefinitelyTyped/blob/knockout/knockout/knockout.d.ts\n\nSo export = module is also causing performance issue.",
