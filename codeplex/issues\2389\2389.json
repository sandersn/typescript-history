    "Description": "I'm receiving an error in the status bar every few seconds while I'm typing to the tune of the following:\r\n\r\nSmart Indenting task took more than 1 second(s) to complete. Try again later. \r\nFormatting task took more than 2 second(s) to complete. Try again later. \r\n\r\nThis is with TypeScript 1.0 on Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 RC.\r\n\r\nI believe this may be an issue that was fixed before but has regressed into the latest TypeScript build. Here's the related issue I found: https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/779\r\n\r\nIf I go into Tools > Options > Text Editor > TypeScript > Tabs and Indenting to \"Block\" or \"None\" instead of \"Smart\" and also uncheck all of the Automatic Formatting options under TypeScript > Formatting > General, the issue goes away, but I also lose a lot of the formatting/indenting functionality.",

      "Message": "Also, note in 2386 the proposed workaround is only to disable formatting on ; but not all formatting options. That is hopefully a less painful workaround for now. If you're still seeing issues after that workaround then this is indeed likely to be a different issue we'll need to investigate so re-open this as appropriate.",
