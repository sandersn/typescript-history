    "Description": "It appears with TypeScript 0.9.5 beta my project has difficulties finding type definition files. It specifically complains a lot about the Q.d.ts type definition file for Kris Kowalski's Q promise library. I see errors saying that property defer or property resolve do not exist on value of type 'typeof Q'. By reintroducing reference paths at the top of each file like \r\n/// <reference path=\"..\\lib\\q.d.ts\"/>\r\nthese particular errors disappear again on compiling. But occasionally when opening files I see these errors appear again. A compile makes them disappear again.\r\nI did not think these reference paths were required anymore. Perhaps it's because my project is a SharePoint 2010 project. \r\nI've emailed Dan Quirk with a link to my project to investigate. \r\n\r\n",
