    "Description": "Try this at the playground:\r\n```\r\ninterface I { }\r\ninterface G { <T>(): I; }\r\ndeclare var f: { g: G; };\r\n\r\nvar x = f.g<number>();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generic call gets a red squiggly, saying \"Cannot select overload for 'call' expression\".\r\n\r\nInterestingly, some variations of this code only cause an error in the language service (in Visual Studio), while the compiler processes this code just fine. Other variations (including the one above) make the compiler produce the error as well. I could find the key difference between these two kinds of the problem.",

I just tried this with the latest bits in our 'develop' branch, and I see the correct behavior, so looks like we already have a fix for this in.\n\nPlease reopen if you don't see this fixed in 'develop' (or our next release if waiting on the 'official' installer).",
