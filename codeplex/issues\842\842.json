    "Description": "#Why?\r\nBecause [].splice is awkward when you have a list of items to insert.\r\n\r\n#Example:\r\nWith current typescript, we have to do this\r\n```\r\nvar list: string[] = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"];\r\nlist.splice.apply(list, (<any>[2, 0]).concat(itemsToPutBetween_b_and_c));\r\n```\r\nwith the \"...\" spread operator implemented in coffeescript and proposed in ECMA6, this would \r\nbe more clearly and simply written like this:\r\n```\r\nvar list: string[] = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"];\r\nlist.splice(list, 2, 0, ...itemsToPutBetween_b_and_c)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#Rationale\r\nWe already support this notation for declaring functions, why not support it when calling them as well?\r\n\r\n#References\r\nhttp://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:spread\r\nhttp://coffeescript.org/#splats\r\nhttp://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/226",
