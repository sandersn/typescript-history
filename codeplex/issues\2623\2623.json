    "Description": "There is a problem with __definitions analyze speed__.\r\n\r\nI have attached a sample project, with little typescript code, just alot of definitions for external js libraries (__Closure Tools__ and __OpenLayers 3__).\r\n\r\nActivating the __intellisense__ starts the __CPU Load__ and if I don't do anything else, its stays full for __~1 minute__.\r\nAfter that when I activate the __intellisense__ again it starts all over.\r\n\r\nFor this __14 lines of code__ Build/Rebuild of the project takes __~13 seconds__.\r\n\r\nThe CPU of the test system has 8 cores (4 logical).\r\nI use __Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 RC__.\r\n\r\nThe process taking the cpu time, when using the intellisense is Visual Studio and TypeScript Compiler (32 bit) when using Build/Rebuild.\r\n\r\nIsn't there some kind of __cache__ of this definitions and the CPU load to happen __only the first time__.",

I haven't had the need to try this myself yet.\n\nThe syntax is add a static=\"true\" property to the reference (all references?) to the file, e.g., \n```typescript\n/// <reference path=\"...\" static=\"true\" />\n```\n\nHmm, I just noticed that there's an error in the regex for this:  Don't mix single and double quotes for the two attributes.  (I'm working on a PR, which should be a one character fix, but the devil's in the details).",
