    "Description": "If a variable is created with the same name as an argument, undefined variables that are assigned to it are not caught by the type checker. For example, the following compiles with no issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Thing\r\n{\r\n\tMethod(p)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tvar p = someRandomThing;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI realize that I shouldn't be var'ing variables in methods with the same name as an argument, but in this case it was an accident, and at present there is no decent linter tool (tslint is useless) that can check for this.",
