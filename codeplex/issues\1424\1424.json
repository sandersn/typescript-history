    "Description": "This does not compile:\r\n```\r\nfunction f<T>(): T { return null; }\r\nfunction higherOrder<U>( f: () => U ): U { return null; }\r\n\r\nvar x = higherOrder( f<number> );\r\n```\r\nbecause the compiler does not recognize `<number>` on the last line as generic argument.\r\n\r\nIf I remove the generic argument, the program does compile:\r\n```\r\nfunction f<T>(): T { return null; }\r\nfunction higherOrder<U>( f: () => U ): U { return null; }\r\n\r\nvar x = higherOrder( f );\r\n```\r\nbut in this case `x` ends up being of type `any`, while I wanted it to be of type `number`.",
