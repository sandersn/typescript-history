    "Description": "Consider\r\n\r\nclass Foo { delete() => { } )\r\n\r\nThen new Foo().delete() is a valid call but results in invalid JS (identical with TS) because 'delete' is reserved.\r\nThis is problematic on IE (even 9!!) and particularly problematic for people using AngularJS (loads of us): https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/angular/QKy0Q6Js5LQ\r\n\r\nI hope this can be solved in the next version (by compiling to new Foo()['delete']() instead)",
