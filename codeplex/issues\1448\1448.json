      "Message": "I'm not having any problems on Chrome (28.0.1500.95 m). This very much looks like a stale cache issue (the listed APIs are new) -- can you do a hard reload + cache clear (hit F12 then right-click the reload button and choose \"Empty Cache and Hard Reload\") and see if that fixes the issue?\n\nIf you still see errors after that, please re-open the issue (click \"Re-open issue\" below the \"ISSUES\" tab) and let us know what OS you're on and any other info that might be helpful.\n\r\n\r** Closed by RyanCavanaugh 08/07/2013 12:35PM",

    {
      "Message": "Yes, the Empty Cache and Hard Reload command fixed the issue. Looking at the Network tab in Chrome, it seems that the issue revolves around typescriptworker2.js being loaded from the cache rather than the server, even when you do an F5 or Ctrl+F5 reload of the page. It looks like typescriptworker2.js is being loaded asynchronously after the page reload is complete, so it may not be respecting the fact that I did a Ctrl+F5 in the browser. I am reopening this issue because it seems as if this is a bug in the way the Playground is asynchronously loading script files -- shouldn't the loader at least be doing an If-Modified-Since request to the server when you do (any kind of) a page reload? The current behavior breaks the standard caching behavior of the browser on reloads.",
