    "Description": "Hi, [according to closed issue #716](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/716) invoking the \"Clean\" command on a project should remove all compiler generated files.\r\n\r\nThis does not yet happen as of 0.9.5.\r\n\r\nI tried this both with the \"Combine JavaScript output into file\" and \"Redirect JavaScript output to directory\" options checked and unchecked. The \"Clean\" command fails to work in any of the cases.\r\n\r\n",
