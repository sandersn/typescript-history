I know that everything works fine if you compile your typescript code to one big js file but we want to create several packages and not only one giant file. We lazy load the parts of the code which are needed. So there are many __extend declarations. We don't like that and also we have similar issues as mentioned in the following <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22155106/typescript-code-coverage-of-multiple-extends-declarations\" rel=\"nofollow\">stackoverflow thread</a>\r<br />\nWhats the best idea to solve this problem?\r<br />\n<br />\nBye and thanks<br />\n",
