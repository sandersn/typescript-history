    "Description": "JavaScript has one underappreciated and largely unknown but very useful feature of creating functions that are out of any scope (but global).\r\nWhen a function is created like this: \r\n```\r\nvar fun = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');\r\n```\r\nthen the resulting `fun` function isn't closed over anything, it doesn't have any scope, but global and thus much more lightweight compared to the conventional counterparts that at least inherit the scope of the module in which they are declared.\r\n\r\nSo for a TypeScript function\r\n```\r\nfunction fun(a: number, b: number) { return a + b; }\r\n```\r\nit would be really nice if the compiler was able to emit the following form:\r\n```\r\n__exports.fun = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a+b');\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```\r\nfunction fun(a, b) { return a + b; }\r\n__exports.fun = fun\r\n```",
