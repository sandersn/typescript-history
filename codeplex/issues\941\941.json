    {
      "Message": "The code\n\n```\n var constructor = x; \n```\n\nalso produces the same error. \n\nI don't mind if the compiler wants to flag these, but this is actually causing the compiler to break and print an internal error. That means the actual source code line where the offending item is located is not output in the error message, making it impossible to locate the source of the error.\n\n",
