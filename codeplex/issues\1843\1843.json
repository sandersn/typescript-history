    "Description": "With the current type system, there does not seem to be a way to give an accurate type to dictionaries:\r\n```\r\nvar dict0 = Object.create(null); // any\r\nvar dict1:{__proto__:void} = Object.create(null); \r\nvar dict2 = {__proto__:null};  // bonus bug: type infered as {__proto__:null}\r\nvar dict3 : {[key:string]:string} = Object.create(null);\r\n\r\n// none of the following are correct, none raise type errors\r\ndict0.toString();\r\ndict1.toString();\r\ndict2.toString();\r\ndict3.toString();\r\n```\r\n1. dictionaries are common, best practice - `any` is not good enough as type\r\n2. `__proto__` has semantics -  should be taken into account for typing\r\n3. `null` is (currently) not a type\r\n4. why do indexers have a prototype?\r\n5. normally, explicit types can work around type system weaknesses - here they can't?\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to separate `null` from `any`: `null`-typed can be assigned to `any`-typed, but not vice-versa, `null`-typed has no properties, `any` may have any properties. If `null` is meant as a placeholder for a writeable `any`-typed location, that can be achieved by `<any>` casting.",
