    "Description": "Hello,\r\nI'm not sure if this issue has been discussed previously, I have done a quick search for it but to no avail.\r\n\r\nI discovered today that when using Visual Studio or tsc (via command line, installed using node's npm packager) that I was getting a \"Error reading file ...: File not found\" error.\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\My Work\\Unit_Tests>tsc -debug typescripttest.ts\r\n   Reading code from C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/TypeScript/lib.d.ts\r\n   Found code at C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/TypeScript/lib.d.ts\r\n   Reading code from C:/Users/Public/Documents/My Work/Unit_Tests/TypescriptTest.ts\r\n   Reading code from C:/Users/Public/Documents/My Work/Unit_Tests/TypescriptTest.str\r\n   Reading code from C:/Users/Public/Documents/My Work/Unit_Tests/TypescriptTest.d.str\r\n   Reading code from C:/Users/Public/Documents/My Work/Unit_Tests/TypescriptTest.d.ts\r\n   Did not find code for C:/Users/Public/Documents/My Work/Unit_Tests/TypescriptTest.ts\r\nError reading file \"typescripttest.ts\": File not found\r\n\r\n\"My Work\" is a substitution for a longer file path which is non-symbolic, which has spaces in it.\r\n\r\nBizarrely enough, the error output knew well enough to capitalize my file name, even though it apparently couldn't find the file :P.\r\n\r\nI went through a number of different scenarios to find out what the problem is, and I discovered that running the tsc on a file on my desktop worked, however running the tsc on my work did not, so I renamed all of the folders in my work so that they had no spaces, and then both the tsc compiling and web essentials compile on save worked.\r\n\r\nI have fixed the issue for myself, but it would be nice if spaces were accommodated in future releases.",
