    "Description": "It seems there's a bug with the parser in ts. \r\nI used a jqgrid definition file \r\n\r\ndeclare module JQGrid {\r\n    export interface JQGrid_Options {\r\n        userData?: any; \r\n        userDataOnFooter?: any; \r\n        viewrecords?: any; // boolean\t If true, jqGrid displays the beginning and ending record number in the grid, out of the total number of records in the query. This information is shown in the pager bar (bottom right by default)in this format: \"View X to Y out of Z\". If this value is true, there are other parameters that can be adjusted, including emptyrecords and recordtext.\tfalse\tNo\r\n        viewsortcols?: any; \r\n        width?: any; \r\n        xmlReader?: any; \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    interface FluidGrid_Options {\r\n        example?: any;\r\n        offset?: number;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nI reference this file in a class it gives me compilation error TS2095: Could not find symbol 'JQGrid'.\r\nIf you look at the comments in the viewrecords property with the part that says '\"View X to Y out of Z\"', if i take the apostrophe out, it compiles perfectly fine. \r\n\r\nIt worked perviously in .8.3 version so just wanted to give a heads up.
