    "Html": "Subject is discussed in specification in 11.1.1 and 11.2.1, but essentially boils down to a magical phrase &quot;the name is resolved in a host dependent manner&quot;. From my experiments with a default TypeScript HTML application project in Visual Studio, I can deduce the following algorithm:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Directories are iterated, starting with a directory where current source file resides, then taking its parent, grandparent, etc., upto the project root.</li>\n<li>Each directory is combined with our module name (including the path).</li>\n<li>File is searched for each combined module name, first with a &quot;.ts&quot; extension, then with a &quot;.d.ts&quot; extension.</li>\n<li>\nIf such file exists, then our module name is resolved to it. Otherwise, proceed to the next (parent) directory.<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nMy questions:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>What kind of hosts are implied in the specification?</li>\n<li>Is my described algorithm correct for a default TS application?</li>\n<li>\nIn which situation a different algorithm is used? Could you provide an example? Where could I read more about them?<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nI'd be very thankful for answers. And I think that the specification should be more detailed here :)<br />\n",
