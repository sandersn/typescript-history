    "Html": "I seems as though in Visual Studio, all TypeScript projects live inside an ASP.NET project. When I choose &quot;HTML Application with TypeScript&quot;, I get /bin and /obj directories created in my project dir with empty ASP.NET dll's behind dropped in my /bin directory. I find this quite annoying as the application I'm writing is purely a client-side browser app.\r<br />\n<br />\nI did find some strange &quot;Virtual Projects&quot; feature by accident in VS. Basically if I drop a .ts file in VS from Finder / Explorer, it spiders the &lt;reference/&gt; graph and displays all those files in the Solution Explorer. It lets me to TypeScript dev without generating a pile of useless files.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo I went ahead and wrote a build script that would scan my directory hierarchy for .ts files, and create a giant file called Home.ts that contains a &lt;reference path=&quot;whatever&quot; /&gt; for each .ts file in the project dir. Then I just open the Home file, and it all works.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis actually solved my problem for a while, however, at some point it VS stopped recognizing file-system level changes to this Home.ts file, so every time I added a new file, I had to close the project and open it again to get it to re-spider the Home.ts file.\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Is this &quot;Virtual Projects&quot; feature documented anywhere?</strong> I can't find any references to it anywhere. I feel like I'm the only one using it.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnd <strong>is there a better way to make an actual TypeScript project</strong> without generating all this additional crap?\r<br />\n<br />\nI've actually moved to WebStorm for this very fact, but I'd be willing to switch back to VS if I can make this work.<br />\n",
