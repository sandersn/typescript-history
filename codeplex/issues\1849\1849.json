Which version of TypeScript are you using? Do you have Web Essentials installed? Do you use Visual Studio to debug, if do which version?\n\nThis this happen only with these 2 files, or with other files too?\n\nPlease, reopen with the button on top. ",

    "Description": "I have a scenario where i have a data services TS and another services TS, but is for something else. So basically I have two TS files that are named...\r\n\r\nPath: /app/data/services.ts\r\nPath: /app/program/services.ts\r\n\r\nThese two TS files load in all browsers and execute properly, but when trying to debug because the two files have the same file name the first TS file loaded is the one that always gets debugged. So, if I put a break point in the second TS file, the break point loads at run-time in the first TS file loaded. The only way to debug the second loaded TS file is to use debugger statements.",
