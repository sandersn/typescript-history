    "Description": "Compiling the code (using 'tsc file.ts')\r\n\r\n    class Person {\r\n        test(private test) {  }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nproduces the error message\r\n\r\n\"__Microsoft JScript runtime error: Unable to get value of the property 'block': object is null or undefined__\"\r\n\r\nI submit this as an issue as the error message was hard to understand. In the code above it's easy to spot that a regular method shouldn't have the private modifier in front of the variable \"test\".\r\n\r\nIn my case however, I was attempting to copy the constructor parameters into private method's parameters, and forgot to remove the private modifiers. The class and method was of some size and thus I had to reduce it to that little code snip above before I could spot the error.\r\n\r\nThis error message was observed in another issue, but with a different cause: http://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/1189",
