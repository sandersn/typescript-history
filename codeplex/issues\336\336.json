How that tool decides it's a file and not object.property notation.\n\nIf you compiled all your TS files into one JS, that reference wouldn't even if as JS â€“ now that would confuse tools.\n\nP.S. Man, this editor is annoying in a mobile browser. ",

I would expect that they would create special nodes. It seems that the references are checked in a precompilation phase.\n\nAnyway it is very easy to modify the compiler.",
