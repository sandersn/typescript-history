    "Description": "In the following code TypeScript playground reports an error about mismatching types on the second declaration of \"b\". Still it doesn't report such an error on the declaration of the variable \"a\", although it has a type which is different from the type of parameter \"a\". But when this code is run, you get \"10\", not \"ququ\", which means that JavaScript treats parameter and variable as one. Either TypeScript should prohibit variables with the name equal to the name of parameters, or it should require that they have a same type.\r\n```\r\nfunction Lalala(a: string) {\r\n\tvar a: number = 10;\r\n\talert(a);\r\n\tif (a == \"10\") {\r\n\t\tvar b: string = \"1\";\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tvar b: number = 2;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\talert(b);\r\n}\r\n\r\nLalala(\"ququ\");\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
