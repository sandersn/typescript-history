    "Description": "As of 0.8.2, when attempting to access unexported of modules or private members of classes the following error message is given: \r\n\r\n\"The property 'Bar' does not exist on value of type 'Foo'\".\r\n\r\nThis error message is technically incorrect. The member *does* exist, it just is not accessible. I think the error message should be fixed to report that it does in fact exist, it is just not accessible. \r\n\r\nI occasionally make this mistake, so a more helpful error message would definitely be a plus.\r\n\r\n[Repro](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground/#src=module%20Foo%20%7B%0A%09var%20Bar%3A%20string%3B%0A%09%0A%7D%0A%0Aclass%20Foo2%20%7B%0A%09private%20Bar2%3A%20number%3B%0A%7D%0A%0Avar%20a%20%3D%20Foo.Bar%3B%0Avar%20b%20%3D%20(new%20Foo2()).Bar2%3B)",
