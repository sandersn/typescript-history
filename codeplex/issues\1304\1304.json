    "Description": "I can't pinpoint what exactly the problem is here, but the following code configuration is throwing the compiler for a loop. On my local machine, it's throwing a stack overflow, but on the playground, I can't tell whether it's crashing or just taking a *really* long time to compile. Here is the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ItemArgs<T>\r\n{\r\n\tconstructor(\r\n\t\tpublic Array: any,\r\n\t\tpublic Index: any,\r\n\t\tpublic Item: any) {}\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\ninterface Array<T>\r\n{\r\n\tList: { (args: ItemArgs<T>): void; }[];\r\n}\r\n```",
