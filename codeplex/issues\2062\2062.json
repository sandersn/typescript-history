    "Description": "I encountered this problem this morning and found the answer on Stack Overflow here: http://stackoverflow.com/q/20500190/761388\r\n\r\nSince the issue doesn't appear to have been raised here I thought I'd copy-paste the contents of that question for visibility (and since the answer works around an issue in TS 0.9.5 as far as I can tell).\r\n\r\nAlex Dresko said:\r\n\r\nThis very playground link used to work before TS 0.9.5 and now I can't figure out how to make it work for the life of me.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground/#src=window.onerror=%20function%28eventOrMessage%3a%20any,%20source%3a%20string,%20fileno%3a%20number%29%7B%0A%09//%20place%20your%20body%20here%20%0A%7D;\r\n\r\nEssentially:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nwindow.onerror= function(eventOrMessage: any, source: string, fileno: number){\r\n    // place your body here \r\n};\r\n```\r\n...returns an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError 8 Cannot convert '(eventOrMessage: any, source: string, fileno: number) => void' to 'ErrorEventHandler': Call signatures of types '(eventOrMessage: any, source: string, fileno: number) => void' and 'ErrorEventHandler' are incompatible.\r\n```\r\n\r\n@steve_fenton shared this solution:\r\n\r\nThis looks like a bug in lib.d.ts to me (and possibly even the compiler) - because they have changed the definition of ErrorEventHandler in the latest branch.\r\n\r\nIn 0.9.5 it is:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface ErrorEventHandler {\r\n    (event: Event, source: string, fileno: number, columnNumber: number): void;\r\n    (message: any, uri: string, lineNumber: number, columnNumber?: number): boolean;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in the master branch it is:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface ErrorEventHandler {\r\n    (event: Event, source: string, fileno: number, columnNumber: number): void;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you could use the following hack (or edit your lib.d.ts file to update it).\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface TempErrorEventHandler {\r\n    (event: Event, source: string, fileno: number, columnNumber: number): void;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar test1: TempErrorEventHandler =\r\n    function (event: Event, source: string, fileno: number, columnNumber: number): void {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nwindow.onerror = <ErrorEventHandler> test1;\r\n```\r\n@basarat shared this solution:\r\n\r\nAs Steve fenton mentioned. Alternatively you can use the common signature between the two functions:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nwindow.onerror= function(eventOrMessage: any, source: string, fileno: number, colnumber?:number):any{\r\n    // place your body here \r\n};\r\n```",
