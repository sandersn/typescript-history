    "Description": "With the following code no error is generated when the base class \"_init\" method is overridden in the derived class.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass BaseClass {\r\n\r\n    constructor () {\r\n        this._init();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private _init() {\r\n        alert(\"base init called\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass DerivedClass extends BaseClass {\r\n\r\n    constructor () {\r\n        super();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private _init() {\r\n        alert(\"derived init called\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nnew DerivedClass();\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom section 8.2.2 of the language specification I got the impression that this would not be allowed.\r\n\r\n> Both public and private members are inherited, but only public members can be overridden.
