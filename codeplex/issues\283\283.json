We still have a number of bugs that were filed internally, but were never mirrored to the CodePlex site, for a number of reasons.\n\nMoving forward, we're definitely trying to be more diligent about filing corresponding CodePlex bugs so external users can follow us as we work against our current backlog.  (We've been making every effort to file new bugs in the open, though.)",
