    "Description": "After upgrading to TypeScript 0.9.1.1 in VS 2012 (Update 3) I am getting a TS compiler error _\"Invalid left-hand side of assignment expression for code which worked in the past\"_. A simplified example to repro is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule Sayings {\r\n\texport function Foo(): string {\r\n\t\treturn \"a\";\t\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nSayings.Foo = () => { return \"b\"; } // Results in \"Invalid left-hand side of assignment expression\" error\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure what I'm doing wrong here, but if I change the assignment expression like so ```<any>(Sayings.Foo) = () => { return \"b\"; }``` everything works.\r\n\r\nThanks",
