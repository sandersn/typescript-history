    "Description": "edit: I guess that the \"this\" needs to be reconsidered because anybody can call the member with a modified \"this\". I would suggest to use this one instead. It would be the same as F# does.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass A {\r\n  private myThis.test() {\r\n    var a = this; // this can be modified from outside\r\n    var b = myThis; // myThis of the class that cannot be modified from outside\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nold:\r\n\r\nTry to run the following. Private member \"b\" has a wrong this when called by result1.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass A {\r\n\tconstructor() {\r\n\t\tvar o = this;\r\n\t\tvar a = [1,2];\r\n\t\tvar result1 = a.map(o.b);\r\n\t\tvar result2 = a.map((v) => { return o.b(v); });\r\n\t\talert(\"result1 = \" + result1);\r\n\t\talert(\"result2 = \" + result2);\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tprivate test = 4;\r\n\t\r\n\tprivate b(v: number) {\r\n\t\treturn v + this.test;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar a = new A();\r\n```",
