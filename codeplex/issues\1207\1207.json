This can be a real time sink because the cause of the problem isn't obvious.\r\n\r\nfilea.ts\r\n``` TypeScript\r\nmodule test {\r\n    export class Test { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nsomefile.ts\r\n``` TypeScript\r\n/// <reference path=\"filea.ts />\r\n//                           ^ note the missing \"\r\nvar x = new test.Test();    // Could not find symbol 'test'.\r\n```",
