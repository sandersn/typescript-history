In JavaScript, I very frequently want to create a &quot;module&quot; with local variables that get passed in to it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<pre><pre>function TestModule(Test, SomeDependency) {\n    function hello(name) {\n        return &quot;Hello &quot; &#43; name;\n    }\n    Test.hello = hello;\n}\n\nvar testModule = TestModule({}, SomeDependency)\ntestModule.hello(&quot;bob&quot;)</pre>\n</pre>\r\n<p>Normally I wouldn't call the function right away, like the above, I would keep the module definition around so I could call it with specific dependencies later.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Are there any plans to support this pattern? What do you think?</p>\r\n",
