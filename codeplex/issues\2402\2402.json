    "Description": "Is there a reason the IDBDatabase declarations were removed from lib.d.ts?\r\n\r\nThis breaks code like ```if( db instanceof IDBDatabase ) ...```.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#idl-interfaces specifies that web-standard interface definitions like IDBDatabase have an associated prototype chain and therefore are backed by an actual object and so ```instanceof``` should be technically allowed.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is a local workaround is to ```declare var IDBDatabase: ...;``` at the outer scope.",
