    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm running IntelliJ/Grails.  \r\n\r\nWhen I first make modifications to MyFile.ts the tsc.exe automatically generates MyFile.js as expected.  Grails then picks up the MyFile.js file and adds it to a resource bundle.  Then grails starts watching the file MyFile.js and puts file locks on the file.\r\n\r\nI can use the [handle](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx) utility to confirm Grails has a lock on the file MyFile.js.\r\n\r\nWhen I invoke tsc.exe with MyFile.ts I get the following error: \"Couldn't write to file xxx\\MyFile.js Write to file failed\"\r\n\r\nIf I manually kill the file locks on MyFile.js using handle, the tsc.exe succeeds with no errors.\r\n\r\nI need a way to tell the tsc.exe to compile the file and ignore whatever locks are on the file.",
