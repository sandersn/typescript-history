    "Description": "It fails with varying symptoms that include any of:\r\n - no autocomplete\r\n - no type hovers or type hovers show `any` instead of real type\r\n - some types are suddenly not known\r\n - sudden syntax errors - showing fragment of code that is different than actual contents of file/editor, for example missing first letter\r\n\r\nSometimes it recovers after reopening file but often it doesn't and I need to restart VS.",
