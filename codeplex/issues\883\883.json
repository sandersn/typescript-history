    "Description": "Typescript already does this for Object literals but doesn't do this for arrays : \r\n\r\n```\r\nvar x = {\r\n d:'', // This coma gets removed \r\n}\r\nvar y = ['1', /* This comma is not removed */];\r\n\r\nalert(y.length.toString()); // 1 so comma is redundant \r\n```\r\nThe generated javascript: \r\n```\r\nvar x = {\r\n    d: ''\r\n};\r\nvar y = [\r\n    '1', \r\n    \r\n];\r\nalert(y.length.toString());\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo biggie but it does crash in IE8 ( and probably below ) so I thought I'd mention it for the community. \r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/7246618/trailing-commas-in-javascript",
