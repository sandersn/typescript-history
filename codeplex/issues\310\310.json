    "Description": "UPDATE: Duplicate of http://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/222 - Please go there instead.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use the --sourcemap flag for my project.\r\n\r\nMy project is set up with multiple files each in their own directory. I then have a little node.js script which gets all the files and passes them in as parameters to the TypeScript compiler which generates all the files. I also keep my source in a src folder and the compiled files in a bin folder.\r\n\r\nThis all works like a charm. The one hitch is the sourcemap doesn't take in to account any of the subdirectories, so it doesn't do much good (it just lists the file names).\r\n\r\nI think in any real world use for large projects (which is what TypeScript is meant for) it would be foolish to believe all code is in one file or that all files are in the same directory (including the source and output).\r\n\r\nI think the sourcemap should take in to consideration the relative directories and add them to the map (making them relative to the directory specified by --out if present).",
