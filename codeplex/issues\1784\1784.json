    "Description": "I'm playing with the latest code in the develop branch of TypeScript.  It finds a new error in our code which compiled without errors in 0.9.1.1.  This may or may not be a bug with the develop version of the compiler.\r\n\r\nWe have this interface:\r\n```\r\nexport interface IMenuItem {\r\n    id: string;\r\n    type: string;\r\n    link?: string;\r\n    classes?: string;\r\n    text?: string;\r\n    icon?: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this code which previously worked but no longer works:\r\n```\r\nvar menuData: Menu.IMenuItem[] = [\r\n    {\r\n        \"id\": \"ourLogo\",\r\n        \"type\": \"image\",\r\n        \"link\": \"\",\r\n        \"icon\": \"modules/menu/logo.svg\"\r\n    }, {\r\n        \"id\": \"productName\",\r\n        \"type\": \"default\",\r\n        \"link\": \"\",\r\n        \"text\": \"Product Name\"\r\n    }\r\n];\r\n\r\nexport = menuData;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error is:\r\n```\r\nCannot convert '{}[]' to 'IMenuItem[]':\r\n\tType '{}' is missing property 'id' from type 'IMenuItem'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe compile to AMD modules.  I've noticed that this works if the array contains just a single object, but not when it contains multiple. Please let me know if you need any additional details.",
