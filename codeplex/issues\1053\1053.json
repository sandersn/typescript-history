      "Message": "@MgSam\n\n@LukeH indicated that there were many instances of Default having to be mis-spelled, but thought they had all been fixed as the grammar rules in the TypeScript compiler had been relaxed to allow reserved JavaScript keywords.\n\nIt turns out there are 3 places in lib.d.ts where Default is intentionally mis-spelled:\n\n1) On HTMLTrackElement as above\n2) On Window.prompt:\n    prompt(message?: string, defaul?: string): string;\n3) On the global prompt function:\n    declare function prompt(message?: string, defaul?: string): string;\n\nSo now I'm not sure whether there is a plan to fix this or not - @LukeH said there is, but @PaulB says there is not.",
