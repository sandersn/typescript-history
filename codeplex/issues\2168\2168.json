The reason for this was because rest params were treated as optional arguments which when used in callbacks is more restrictive than non-optional arguments (somewhat unintuitively, see https://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/428458). We have some design changes coming on this front to better match peoples' expectations though.",

    "Description": "I'm working with a codebase using JQuery Promises which is using jquery.d.ts.  I have a simple continuation like:\r\n\r\n    foo( ... ).then(\r\n        success => { ... },\r\n        error => { ... });\r\n\r\nI'm receiving compile error:\r\n\r\n    Error\t103\tSupplied parameters do not match any signature of call target:\r\n\tCall signatures of types '(error: any) => void' and '(...reasons: any[]) => void' are incompatible:\r\n\t\tCall signature expects 0 or fewer parameters.\r\n\r\nIf I manually duplicate the line in jquery.d.ts from:\r\n\r\n    then<U>(onFulfill: (value: T) => U, onReject?: (...reasons: any[]) => U, onProgress?: (...progression: any[]) => any): JQueryPromise<U>;\r\n\r\ninto\r\n\r\n    then<U>(onFulfill: (value: T) => U, onReject?: (reason: any) => U, onProgress?: (...progression: any[]) => any): JQueryPromise<U>;\r\n\r\nit will work.  This seems to me to be an error how params arrays are interpreted, at least it would be from a C# perspective of params arrays.\r\n\r\nDid not seem to be an issue in vanilla VS 2013.  I checked there and it seems to come with TS 0.9.1.  When I installed the TS 0.9.5 upgrade, the error surfaced.",
