Adding this line into existing projects does seem to work, but it should do that automatically when adding a TypeScript file.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKori\r\n",

Did you add your TypeScript files to that item group elsewhere in the project file?  e.g.\n\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <TypeScriptCompile Include=\"app.ts\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n\nYou can see an example of this from other project templates.  This item group expands the list of files onto the command line.\n\nAs you indicate, ideally we would automatically add the build step if you add a .ts file to a project.  For this Alpha release however, adding the compile as a pre-build step as indicated is the recommended approach.\n\nLet me know if this answers your question.",
