    "Html": "There is no &quot;addmatchers&quot; in the &quot;jasmine&quot; module space.  It's in the &quot;Spec&quot; interface.  Can you post some example code?<br />\n<br />\nI took a quick peek at the jasmine.js file and I only see a reference to &quot;window.jasmineRequire&quot;, not &quot;window.jasmine&quot;...?<br />\n<br />\nAnyhow, you are only defining interfaces, and the interfaces only look like they are mixing both static and instance declarations. For example, you could do this:<br />\n<pre><code>    interface Any {\n        jasmineMatches(other: any): boolean;\n        jasmineToString(): string;\n    }\n    var Any: {\n        new (expectedClass: any): Any;\n    }</code></pre>\n\nor this<br />\n<pre><code>    class Any {\n\n        constructor(expectedClass: any);\n\n        jasmineMatches(other: any): boolean;\n        jasmineToString(): string;\n    }</code></pre>\n\nYou had this:<br />\n<pre><code>   interface Any {\n        new (expectedClass: any): Any;\n        jasmineMatches(other: any): boolean;\n        jasmineToString(): string;\n    }</code></pre>\n\nWhich is not correct.  You are saying here that an object instance of type &quot;Any&quot; is a constructor function (because of &quot;new (...)&quot;) but also that the FUNCTION itself (static object) contains the listed <em>instance</em> methods (which doesn't seem to be the case in the file I saw).  As well, you cannot reference &quot;interface Any&quot; in actual JS code (it's only a type).<br />\n",
