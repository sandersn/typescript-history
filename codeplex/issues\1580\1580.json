    "Description": "Visual Studio 2012 Pro with MySQL Visual Studio 1.0.2 plugin installed breaks TypeScript 0.9.1.1 intellisense. \r\n\r\nI had the MySQL plugin installed with the previous TypeScript version 0.9.1 and had no problems with the intellisense. Once I upgraded to 0.9.1.1 the intellisense did not work at all. If you hover over instance methods it will correctly identify it, but when you type out a module or class, or even use '.' after an instance of a class, no suggestions pops up.\r\n\r\nOnce MySQL plugin was uninstalled intellisense works again.",
