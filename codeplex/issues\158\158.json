When comments are preserved the value of the code is preserved, and the .js file can be copied from one project that uses TypeScript to another project that may not. TypeScript is easier to \"sell\" to my coworkers if there are no downsides to using TypeScript. Right now, the fact that comments get swallowed is a downside.",
