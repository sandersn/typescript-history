One solution was to modify the lib.d.ts file, but that didn't seem right.</p>\r\n<p>Now I just found out that interfaces are also open.&nbsp;So to be able to call for example the sync method on a function without tsc complaining, I just included the following in my declaration file:</p>\r\n<p><em>interface Function { &nbsp;</em><br>\r\n<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; sync(thisArg: any, ...argArray: any[]): any;</em><br>\r\n<em>}</em></p>\r\n<p><em>and now I can just use my normal code like</em></p>\r\n<p><em>var txt = fs.readFile.sync(.....);</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Just&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I share my findings since I saw some emails from people facing&nbsp;similar&nbsp;problems. TS is really starting to grow on me. Great job!</p>\r\n",
