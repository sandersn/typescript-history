    "Html": "I installed the Visual Studio Update 2 this morning, which installed the latest version of the TypeScript compiler. It also, without asking, uninstalled the previous version of the TypeScript compiler (0.9). This means that I am completely unable to compile my code where the projects are referencing the 0.9 version of the compiler. I can update my projects to point to 1.0, but if I checkout an older version of my code, I can't compile it.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlthough the Visual Studio Update was rude and uninstalled an essential part of my build without asking, I figured that I would be able to re-install that version of the compiler to get it working again. But I can't find any way to download any version of the TypeScript compiler prior to 1.0. They all seem to have disappeared from the Microsoft Downloads site.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there really no way for me to build using the 0.9 compiler now that I have installed Visual Studio Update 2?<br />\n",
