As others have alluded to, you likely have some Unicode or other special characters in your file that are causing it to be in some encoding the compiler doesn't understand (perhaps you copied some text out of webpage or Word doc that had smart quotes, foreign characters, etc). You'll need to remove these characters and/or save the file in a supported encoding. ",
