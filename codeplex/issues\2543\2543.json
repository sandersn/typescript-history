    "Description": "In the current LanguageService design, when the proper ordering of TypeScript source files changes it is necessary to re-create the LanguageService to flush the cached ordering.  It would be nice if this could be handled more gracefully.  There are likely many ways of improving this but ideally the language service could completely handle the ordering of files by parsing the <reference> comments as necessary (although this may not be possible to do in a well-performing way based on the information discussed in the below thread).\r\n\r\nFirst discussed here:\r\nhttps://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/547482",
