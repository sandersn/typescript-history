    "Html": "Unfortunately, not.  This is because ///reference has meaning to TypeScript that's different than what other tools are using it for.  You might be able to work around this by using a different kind of comment, preserving the comment, and then using a second pass on the output .js to convert it back to the style you're looking for.  That wouldn't fix editing the .ts from the IDE, so I'm not sure if it fixes your particular issue.<br />\n",
