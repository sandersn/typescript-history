The .ts-file is formerly a .js-file that I'm on my way to convert. I will continue to look for what could be causing this problem.",

      "Message": "I have encountered this problem today. It was caused by a missing static member in a class declared later in the same module - simple mistake while editing. All code is in a single file.\n\nMy code follows the pattern I've listed below but I haven't been able to reproduce the problem in a small example and the below code is handled correctly, raising the error message: \"464.ts(9,17): The property 's_v1' does not exist on value of type '{ s_v0: number; new(v: number): C; }' \".\n\nI would note that my biggest issue is that Visual Studio hangs when the error is present and I had to resort to tsc.exe at the command line to debug.
