    "Description": "It's really just a minor issue, but never mind. There's a missing single quotation mark in a tsc error message in __/src/compiler/typeFlow.ts__ ( commit __19cc63619d8d__, branch __release-0.9.0-alpha__ ), right after propertyName.actualText:\r\n\r\n```\r\n \"The property '\" + propertyName.actualText + \" on type '\" + leftType.getScopedTypeName(this.scope) + \"' is not visible\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould actually be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n \"The property '\" + propertyName.actualText + \"' on type '\" + leftType.getScopedTypeName(this.scope) + \"' is not visible\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's a similar message just a few lines above which is fine.\r\n\r\nThis is also the case in previous versions, however this issue is of course far from being critical.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
