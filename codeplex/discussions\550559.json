There would be several use cases of <em>Promise&lt;undefined&gt;</em> as it would be useful when no result data is required, while I couldn't find more examples in other W3C specifications.\r<br />\n<br />\nI think this is worth to be discussed if there is no proper workaround other than using <em>any</em> type.<br />\n",
