    "Description": "Great work on sourcemap support in 0.8.1.  Being able to debug typescript code in Visual Studio is super useful.  \r\n\r\nIs it possible to take this one step future and attach Visual Studio to an application running in node.js?  I believe this could be accomplished with the following:\r\n\r\nCreate a node.js Visual Studio project type.\r\nSet a startup script file (program.ts)\r\nThe run action would:\r\n\tOpen a console window \r\n\tExecute \"node program.ts\"\r\n\tWhen the process exited, pause with \"Press any key to continue...\"\r\nThe debug action would: \r\n\tOpen a console window \r\n\tExecute \"node --debug={RANDOM_PORT} program.ts\"\r\n\tVisual Studio would connect to {RANDOM_PORT} on localhost\r\n\tSome Visual Studio debugger magic to interact with the node debug service\r\n\tUse source maps to show typecript instead of javascript\r\n(Optinal) Add the ability to attach to and debug a running node process\r\n\tIn *nix enviornments this is possible by signallying node using kill -s USR1 {PID}, not sure what a similar funciton in windows would look like\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector is a great example application which allows for interactive node debugging.  It uses the debbuger interfaces built into webkit browsers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
