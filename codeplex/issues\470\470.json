    "Description": "in the example below which comes from your TypeScriptHTMLApp template, and put a break point in function of setInterval of the start function and when the break point hits and anlyze the this keyword, it shows up as the element that triggered the event and not this (the greeter class). Debugging the js file shows the right context because var _this = this is added, but doesn't work in TS debugging.\n\nclass Greeter {\n    element: HTMLElement;\n    span: HTMLElement;\n    timerToken: number;\n    \n    constructor (element: HTMLElement) { \n        this.element = element;\n        var s = \"\";\n        this.element.innerText += \"The time is: \";\n        this.span = document.createElement('span');\n        this.element.appendChild(this.span);\n        this.span.innerText = new Date().toUTCString();\n    }\n\n    start() {\n        this.timerToken = setInterval(() => {\n/* PUT BREAK POINT ON LINE BELOW */\n            this.span.innerText = new Date().toUTCString()\n        }, 500);\n    }\n\n    stop() {\n        clearTimeout(this.timerToken);\n    }\n\n}\n\nwindow.onload = () => {\n    var el = document.getElementById('content');\n    var greeter = new Greeter(el);\n    greeter.start();\n};",
