    "Description": "hey i did a base class that binds the values from the server to an object to create some sort of an entity set\r\n\r\nwithin the class constructor (the `super class`) there's a method called _init (which is private) that filters through some properties from the incoming JSON (that is; incoming from the server)\r\nhowever when i reference the this - it is actually pointing to the window\r\n\r\n???",
