    "Html": "<p>Rekna,</p>\r\n<p>I just have node.js with the TypeScript module pre-installed on the build server. It's not the most ideal solution, but it works. I have put together a quick CI starter project up on my GitHub to help people who are trying to do this very thing. You can find it here: <a href=\"https://github.com/jmvrbanac/TypeScript-CI-Starter\">TypeScript-CI-Starter</a>. The project uses Gradle for build automation and PhantomJS to run the Jasmine tests. It also generates JUnit xml reports so it can be easily consumed by a CI server. This seems to work pretty smoothly within Jenkins. I haven't had time to figure out how to hook up code coverage, but what is there seems to work for now.</p>\r\n<p>- John</p>",
