    "Description": "I have a .ts file that performs a normal:\r\n\"import mongo = module('mongodb');\"\r\n\r\nSometimes, without touching anything in that .ts file, the linked .js file is updated removing the require call in that statement:\r\n\r\n\"var mongo = require('mongodb');\"\r\n->\r\n\"var mongo = 'mongodb';\"\r\n\r\nThat's a bit awkward because it yields to several problems not realted with my code.\r\nI'm using the lastest 0.9 LKG and it happens with the released beta too.\r\nI'm including the related code and a couple of screenshots showing the problem.",

I have removed lines to see what makes it fail and it seems that the file was in ansi instead of utf-8 and had some special characters in comments. Example: \"//- sets strict mode , if true then existing collections can’t be “recreated” etc.\"\n\nIf I convert the file from ANSI to UTF-8 the problem disappears.\n\nSo if it just supports utf-8 it should yield a more descriptive error instead of just saying it cannot be resolved.",
