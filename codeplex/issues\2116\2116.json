(Solution explorer always goes to the first file while the output window always shows the second one)\r\n\r\nThis is reproduceable - see attached prj.\r\n\r\nTypescript 0.9.5.0",

Tried originally opening Class1.ts from the Solution Explorer, the virtual project node, and from 'Open File' without seeing it duplicated when double-clicking through the output window. Can you re-open with some extra info?\n\n * Are you using VS2012 or VS2013?\n * How did the .ts file get opened the first time?\n * When you see two tabs, what's the result of right-clicking each tab title and selecting \"Copy Full Path\" ? Same filename gets into the clipboard, or is there any difference?\n\nThanks!\n\r\n\r** Closed by RyanCavanaugh 01/21/2014 2:57PM",
