    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nSo back in the day, TypeScript used strings as for in iterator variables. This was correct as far as JavaScript goes, but I guess people complained because it was too strict.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo currently for in variables are type <code>any</code>. Period.\r<br />\n<br />\nWould it be possible to add explicit types to the variable declaration in a for in loop? Example:<br />\n<pre><code>for (var userId: string in obj) {\n    console.log(obj[userId]);\n}</code></pre>\n\nThat is consistent with other places you can use var where explicit types are allowed, and it would allow writing safer code.<br />\n",

Since they may later use other languages, I urge them to use explicit type annotations to get used to it. The exception in this loop is a very weak spot and an inconsitency, I can't explain to them. At least it should be possible to give an explicit any-annotation.<br />\n",
