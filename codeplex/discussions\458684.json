This way you cannot use it in place of a string marked &quot;firstName&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nSomething like this:<br />\n<pre><code>var myEmail = &quot;whatever@mycompany.com&quot;&lt;email&gt;;\nvar myFirstName = &quot;Mathew&quot;&lt;firstName&gt;;\nmyFirstName = myEmail; // &lt;-------- compilation error</code></pre>\n\nThis is additional type safety feature that contribute to the quality of the code yet doesn't have a footprint on the target code (units will be type-erased just like every other type annotation in TypeScript)<br />\n<br />\nA clumsy alternative to units are wrapper classes which are harder to maintain, come with an noticeable performance overhead, bloat the type system and don't solve the problem, because a wrapped value still can be misused.<br />\n",
