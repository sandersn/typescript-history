    "Description": "I am using Typescript 0.9.5 with visual studio 2013 (I also have a recent web essentials installed, but have disabled all typescript options).  My project is using Team Foundation Server to manage the source.\r\n\r\nAll is working very well, with one exception:  I cannot compare my typescript files with the previous version in TFS.  Attempting to do so displays the split comparison window momentarily and then Visual Studio crashes.  All other file type comparisons are fine.\r\n\r\nAlthough this isn't a show stopper, it is definitely annoying to not be able to check my changes.\r\n\r\nHope this can be resolved.\r\n\r\nMany thanks.",

      "Message": "Yes,  you are correct.  Comparing with a previous checked in version. I have tried the same scenario on a co workers machine and the was no crash.  However,  their machine is 64 bit windows with a large amount of memory.  Although there was no crash there was a massive jump in cpu usage and noticeable slow down on the machine.  My machine is only 32 but windows with 3gb of memory,  so I suspect the jump in cpu usage caused the crash.  ",
