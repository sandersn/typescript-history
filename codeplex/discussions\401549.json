I've did already find the ACE version shortly after I posted here, but it looks like it is written using CoffeeScript, and I'm not interested in wasting my time learning a new syntax to transcode into JavaScript to get an editor for TypeScript, which also transcodes to JavaScript. ;) I was exploring the idea thought of just implementing my own editor using TypeScript and ACE ... anyone have TS definition files for ACE yet?

In addition to the conventional use-cases I can think of many situations where I'd like users to be able to &quot;annotate&quot; GUI components at run-time with code fragments to alter their behaviour. At present Javascript can be used for this, but is more error-prone and clunky than I'd like.  So being able to use TypeScript, with the additional safety that comes from the type inference, together with a web editor supporting intellisense driven by this type information, would be great.  It would make moving over to TypeScript a much easier &quot;sell&quot;.  So it would be helpful if someone in Microsoft could let us know what the plans are for the software used in the Playground Editor.  It looks like Microsoft have done a really good job of building a web editor that fully exploits the additional information provided by TypeScript, and it is a real asset to the TypeScript project.  It would be a real shame if the editor was forever constrained to live inside the playground, or just within Microsoft projects for example. <br />\n",
