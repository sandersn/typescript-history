    "ClosedComment": "Thanks for reporting this. \n\nThe performance increases we've been focusing on are: improvements when doing an incremental typecheck, So, if you have an existing file and have that typechecked, then make a change and typecheck again. This has reduced the performance for the initial typecheck, which you're experiencing. Further we've focused on correctness over performance for the preview release.\n\nYou should see further improvements in performance over the next couple of releases.",

    "Description": "Adding source units and then calling pullTypeCheck method is very slow in 0.9.0.\r\n\r\nConsider following example:\r\n```\r\nfor(var iCode = 0; iCode < this.resolvedEnvironment.code.length; iCode++) {\r\n    var code = this.resolvedEnvironment.code[iCode];\r\n    if (code.content != null) {\r\n        compiler.addSourceUnit(code.path, TypeScript.ScriptSnapshot.fromString(code.content), 0, false, code.referencedFiles);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ncompiler.pullTypeCheck();\r\n```\r\nThis was way faster in 0.8.3:\r\n```\r\nfor(var iCode = 0; iCode < this.resolvedEnvironment.code.length; iCode++) {\r\n    var code = this.resolvedEnvironment.code[iCode];\r\n    compiler.addUnit(code.content, code.path, false, code.referencedFiles);\r\n}\r\ncompiler.typeCheck();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt was said that 0.9.0 compiler would be faster than 0.8.3 but type checking got worse.\r\nWhat I actually need is to do syntactic and semantic analysis on some files without compilation. Setting compiler flag \"parseonly\" is almost OK but it only does syntactic analysis without semantic. Am I doing anything wrong?",
