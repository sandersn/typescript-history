The root cause of the crash was when the file we were compiling had a variable declaration with missing generic parameters, if that helps you any.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to pull and build the latest compiler sources from our git repo. That should be enough to tell you where the error is; at that point you can fix the issue in your source and then either revert back to the 0.9.1 release or just keep going on the latest sources.\r\n\r\nIf you're still seeing the crash on the latest compiler sources, please re-open the bug (use the button just below the 'ISSUES' tab) with an updated call stack so we can keep investigating.
