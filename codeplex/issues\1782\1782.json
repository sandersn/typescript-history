    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI tried some code and got a rpboem with this: http://pastebin.com/nVMxcHRF\r\nHere is the link to the live example on typescriptlang.org: http://tinyurl.com/osqefxd\r\n\r\nIf you take a look inside firebug you can see this: http://i.imgur.com/uzvpmPi.png?1\r\nand in chrome this: http://i.imgur.com/ZjBeNRN.png?1\r\n\r\nSo the problem is this: var _this = this; _this.replace. When I edit the TS code to this.replace, all is ok.\r\n\r\nI was in the IRC of TS and had a discussion about it and it only happens with arrow functions outside classes. When I edit line 7 from \"(args: Array) => {\" to \"functuon(args: Array) {\" all is ok, but I think () => 3 and function() { return 3; } is the same anonymous function, so both should work correctly, or not?\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nChris",
