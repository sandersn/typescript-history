I am using require to load everything. I have a problem of the path of the files in TypeScript. I have created require config<br />\n<pre><code>require.config({\npaths: {\n    VideoProviderCommon: 'Scripts/VideoProvider/VideoProviderCommon',\n    VideoProviderManagerFactory: 'Scripts/VideoProvider/VideoProviderManagerFactory',\n    VideoProviderManager: 'Scripts/VideoProvider/VideoProviderManager'\n},\nshim: {\n    'VideoProviderCommon': { 'exports': 'VideoProviderCommon' },\n    'VideoProviderManagerFactory': { 'exports': 'VideoProviderManagerFactory' },\n    'VideoProviderManager': { 'exports': 'VideoProviderManager' }\n}</code></pre>\n\n});\r<br />\n<br />\nand I want that the js files will have in the define - the module name as configured and not the path, how ever I cannot compile the TypeScript project cause I get compile errors\r<br />\nin <br />\n<pre><code>import common = require(&quot;VideoProviderCommon&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n\nfor example - as it cannot find the module although I have require config<br />\n",

    "Html": "The TypeScript compiler doesn't currently support reading a require config, so you would need to provide the information to the compiler another way.\r<br />\n<br />\nOne way to do this would be to declare your external modules.  For example, declaring &quot;VideoProviderCommon&quot; above:<br />\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">declare</span> <span style=\"color:Blue;\">module</span> <span style=\"color:#A31515;\">&quot;VideoProviderCommon&quot;</span> {\n    <span style=\"color:Green;\">// module contents</span>\n}\r\n</pre></div>You may be able to generate these based on what you're loading.  Some of the people on the forums may have done something similar when using require config.<br />\n",
