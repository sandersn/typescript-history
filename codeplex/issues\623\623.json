    "Description": "So after being spoilt by the awesomeness of C# syntax highlighting for so long (and now finally C++!), it has been somewhat depressing entering the world of TypeScript, because none of my classes, interfaces, etc. are colored any differently from the surrounding text (they're all black). I like my code to look all pretty and colorful.\r\nIs it too much to ask to make them use the \"User Types\" color as specified in the VS font options?\r\nThat would be uber-awesome.\r\nCheers",
