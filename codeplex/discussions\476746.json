Specifically, now when you merge interface A with the later interface A (let's call it B), interface B's set of overloads will get a higher priority than A's overloads.<br />\n\r<br />\nThis should make it much more natural to model jQuery plugins and to add new overloads to overloads in lib.d.ts (among others), as you can just reference the plugin or new functionality after the original library.<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can find a little more info about it on the breaking change notices:\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://typescript.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Known%20breaking%20changes%20between%200.8%20and%200.9&amp;referringTitle=Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://typescript.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Known%20breaking%20changes%20between%200.8%20and%200.9&referringTitle=Documentation</a><br />\n",
