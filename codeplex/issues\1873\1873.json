    "Description": "I would like to keep typings in a separate d.ts file for a typescript file. This means Ive got a class without any types in the main ts file and all the details regarding params and return types are kept in the definition file.\r\n\r\nMotivation is to have a cleaner js code in the ts file and also an experiment with typed coffeescript (transpiled to TS).\r\n\r\nRight now, after including the one.d.ts file inside the one.ts file I'm getting the following error:\r\n```\r\nerror TS2000: Duplicate identifier 'One'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I expect would be merging those types into the ts file on the compiler level. Some pre-processing tool would also solve the case. Any ideas?",
