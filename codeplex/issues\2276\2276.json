    "Description": "The title says it all. More specifically, private properties of classes end up untyped.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule M {\r\n  export class C {\r\n    X: number;\r\n    private Y: string;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen compiled with the both the `-d` and the `-noImplicitAny` options, this file yields the following typings:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeclare module M {\r\n    class C {\r\n        public X: number;\r\n        private Y;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf these typings are then fed back to the compiler with `-noImplicitAny` option, the compilation fails, complaining that property `Y` implicitly has type `any`.",
