    "Description": "Given a solution with:\r\n1. Assembly Common with Common.ts that produces Common.js\r\n2. Common.js is set to be an embedded resource\r\n3. Assembly RefCommon with SomeClass.ts containing direct reference to Common.ts via \r\n/// <reference path=\"Path/to/Common.ts\"/>\r\n4. Assembly RefCommon references assembly Common\r\n5. Some other assembly RefCommon2 with the same setup as RefCommon\r\n\r\nWhen building solution, then, sometimes, an error: \"TS5011: Emit Error: Write to file 'Common.ts' failed\" is occurred.\r\nThis error is hugely depends on environment (on some machines it never occurs, on others it can occur almost on every compilation).\r\n\r\nA workaround is to create typings for Common assembly and references this file instead of direct references to ts files.",
