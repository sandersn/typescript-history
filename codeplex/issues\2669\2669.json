    "Description": "I tried installing the new TS 1.5 beta, but had to uninstall due to an issue w/ it handling webgl variables. (i have another issue open for that).\r\n\r\nHowever, I was unable to successfully revert back to 1.4 even after numerous repairs/reinstalls of tsc 1.4 and 1.5 and even a repair of all visual studio.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the errors  I was getting:\r\nError\t2\tThe specified task executable location \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\TypeScript\\1.4\\1.4\\tsc.exe\" is invalid.\tC:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v12.0\\TypeScript\\Microsoft.TypeScript.targets\t103\t5\tTypeScriptHTMLApp7\r\n\r\nEssentially all the repairs and reinstalls were placing the sdk at: \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\TypeScript\\1.4\\tsc.exe\" instead of : \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\TypeScript\\1.4\\1.4\\tsc.exe\", which was where VS was looking.\r\n\r\nSo to fix i just moved everything to where it was looking for it.\r\n",
