    "Description": "If I compile the following file test.ts\r\n\r\n    #   \r\n    class Test {\r\n    }  \r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n    tsc test.ts\r\n\r\nno output file is produced and the compiler does not give any warnings or errors. If I put the hash line after the class declaration test2.ts\r\n  \r\n    class Test {\r\n    }\r\n    #  \r\n\r\nthe compiler reports no errors and generates output file test2.js\r\n\r\n    var Test = (function () {\r\n        function Test() { }\r\n        return Test;\r\n    })();\r\n\r\nWhat's going on here?",
