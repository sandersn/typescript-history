    "Description": "I've found the [playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground/) is a very easy way to quickly try out some TypeScript code without opening up an IDE. It would be helpful if the playground had a few additional features:\r\n- Listed the compiler version number (and maybe even the build number) that it's running.\r\n- Allowed the user to switch between versions of the compiler. Major releases would be ok, but if this was linked to the nightly builds that would be even better. This would be extremely helpful to explore new language features as they're added without having to download and set up experimental builds.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd really like to test out the 0.9 features without having to replace my current 0.8.3 environment which I'm using for development.",
