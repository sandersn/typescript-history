It wouldn't be possible without this. For me, it was very unlikely to try something this big with raw javascript or languages like cofeescript without types and generics. And personally I prefeer typescript over dart, and I think it is more aligned with future standards. So, keep up the good work! :)\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm looking forward for the next release with stability and performance improvements.\r<br />\n<br />\nIt almost work perfect most of the times (in some rare cases it stop compiling some files and I have to restart the IDE).\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso I have files like this:<br />\n<pre><code>import _file = require('./manager/file');\nexport import Device = _file.Device;</code></pre>\n\nAnd that is currently not working. I have to do this as a hack to get rid of that problem:<br />\n<pre><code>import _file = require('./manager/file'); _file.Device;\nexport import Device = _file.Device;</code></pre>\n\nIt is planed to get fixed?\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards.<br />\n",
