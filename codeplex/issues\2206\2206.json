    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a simple Visual Studio 2013 project that reproduces the problem.\r\n\r\nThe project compiles correctly as it stands.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to move declarations file \"Bar.d.ts\" from its present location to the \"typings\" folder. When I do that and in Foo.ts I change the reference like so:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\n/// <reference path=\"typings/Bar.d.ts\" />\r\n\r\nimport BarBar = require(\"Bar\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get a compiler error on the import statement: \"Unable to resolve external module \"Bar\".\r\n\r\nWhy is the location of the declarations file important? And how do I fix this?\r\n\r\nThis is a node JS project and I need to have the import statement exactly as it is, because that's how the npm package is structured (Bar is an exported class).\r\n\r\nThanks.",
