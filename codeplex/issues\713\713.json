    "Description": "I know this has been addressed before, just could not find it now, sorry for repetition\r\n\r\nTrying to create a query widget I need something like :\r\n\r\n    $.widget(\"app.somewidget\", {_create:()=>{this.element...}});\r\n\r\ntypescript will convert \"this\" to \"_this\", but placing _this = this in a wrong place (topmost in the file) which of course does not work for the widget.\r\n\r\nI found out this ugly workaround works:\r\n\r\n    var somewidget = {\r\n        _create: () => {\r\n            $(\"<span></span>\").text(\"Something\").insertAfter(this.element);\r\n            () => { this } // weird workaround\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    $.widget(\"app.somewidget\", somewidget);\r\n\r\ni.e. adding another closure to force typescript to add an extra _this=this, and this one on the right place:\r\n\r\n    var somewidget = {\r\n        _create: function () {\r\n            var _this = this;\r\n            $(\"<span></span>\").text(\"Something\").insertAfter(_this.element);\r\n            (function () {\r\n                _this;\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\nSometimes it's just wrong by typescript to add _this=this. Perhaps it would be nice to have some notation to make typescript keep the original syntax?\r\n\r\n            $(\"<span></span>\").text(\"Something\").insertAfter(@this.element);\r\n\r\nAnother ugly workaround to make typescript dont mind my 'this':\r\n\r\n            $(\"<span></span>\").text(\"Something\").insertAfter(eval('this').element);\r\n",

I obviously need to refresh my knowledge about ()=> vs function in typescript.\n",
