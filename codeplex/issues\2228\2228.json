    "Description": "It would be good if it was possible to control the indentation style/level for the JS outputted by tsc.\r\n\r\nIt currently always indents with 4 spaces, but existing codebases may have other indentation styles (2 spaces is very common) that are enforced by linting tools. This makes it necessary to either change the indentation style across the whole codebase, to add an exception for TS-generated files, or to add a post-compile step which re-indents all files. Neither of these is a desirable solution.",
