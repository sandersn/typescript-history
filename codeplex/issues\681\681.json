    "Description": "If you try to add to a WinJS windows 8 application the PhoneGap/Cordova win8 javascript library and then take the d.ts from https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped you get an error where it says that many of the types are duplicately defined. (Due to both PhoneGap and the core definitions)\r\n\r\nIs there a way to resolve this in VS 2012?\r\n\r\nNote, I have also asked this over on SO http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14597183/typescript-signature-for-is-duplicated\r\n\r\nSorry - I meant to add this as a 'discussion' item. Hope this is ok for now...",
