    "Description": "Using 0.9.1.1, the following will not compile:\r\n\r\n    var result = calculateResult();\r\n    console.assert(result);\r\n\r\nThe intention here is clearly to assert that the result is truthy. However the declaration of `console.assert` as defined in `lib.d.ts` requires a `boolean`. Hence the code must be rewritten to something like this:\r\n\r\n    console.assert(!!result);\r\n\r\nI believe the first argument should be of type `any`.",
