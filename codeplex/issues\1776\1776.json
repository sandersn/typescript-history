    "Description": "I'm opening this apart from report #1768. My optimism about intellisense working when I moved files from a subfolder to the main folder was premature. It's stopped working again -- as if some cache is remembering things it oughtn't and is getting confused again.\r\n\r\nSo I move the TS files back to a subdirectory and intellisense is working again! And it stopped the problem of having copies of the file in multiple buffers ... until it fails again.\r\n\r\nBTW, it would be nice if the JS and JS.MAP files were in a separate folder just to keep the folders with the TS files a bit cleaner. But that's part of a separate discussion about making the generated files a resoruce.\r\n",
