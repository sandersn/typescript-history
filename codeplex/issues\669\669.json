    "ClosedComment": "Thank you for your suggestion.\n\nAll suggestions are currently possible, you can create a project.ts file, which contains all the files in your project (though it would not traverse sub-directories) and modules are entirely optional.\n\nThe third suggestion is possible by using the --out parameter when compiling your files.\n\ne.g.\n\ntsc project.ts --out collections.js\n\n",

    "Description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI would suggest a drastic change :) No module at all, and no ///reference declaration neither... \r\n\r\nI would personnaly prefer :\r\n\r\n1)No ///reference\r\n\r\nhaving to tell the compiler where to find files to compile, eg a config file describing every directories to target (sub-directories will be deduced)... Once done, we don't need to make a ///ref in the code, everything may be find through the config file\r\n\r\n2) No module\r\n\r\nwe don't need modules ; we have classes, and even static declaration for both variables and functions... If you want to modularize, but into stuff classes...\r\n\r\n3) Assemblies\r\n\r\nit would be valuable to have a \"assembly\" statement at the beginning of the file where putting the name of a js. library we want to generate. By default, it would be \"app\".\r\n\r\nSo we could generate different .js files from a bunch of ts files, eg collection.js, streams.js, http.js and app.js \r\n\r\n\r\nbest regards\r\n\r\nXavier\r\n",
