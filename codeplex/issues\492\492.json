    "Description": "Consider following ambient class declaration: sample.d.ts\r\n\r\n/// <reference path='libs/angular-1.0.d.ts' />\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nmodule sample\r\n{\r\n    declare class FooLog implements ng.ILogService {\r\n        error: ng.ILogCall; // I would like to omit this\r\n        info: ng.ILogCall; // I would like to omit this\r\n        log: ng.ILogCall; // I would like to omit this\r\n        warn: ng.ILogCall; // I would like to omit this\r\n\r\n        bar():void;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nMy intention is to ambiently declare class, which is implemented in js. \r\nI would like to express that it implements an interface ng.ILogService.\r\nUnfortunately TypeScript forces me to repeat method signatures of the ng.ILogService in the ambient body of FooLog class. It creates duplication and breaks separation.\r\nI could not switch to ambient interface in this case because I would like to be able to call constructor of the class from TypeScript. So I have to keep same class name as js prototype.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: relax the compiler to not check whether all the interfaces are fully implemented on the ambient class declaration.\r\n\r\n",
