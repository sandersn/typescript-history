    "Description": "Currently TS compiler prohibits \";\" after index signatures in classes (at least in playground). This is bad, because there is no way to declare two index signatures one after another.\r\n\r\nP.S. Yes, this is according to spec, but spec is illogical and error prone here.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass A {\r\n\t[index: string]: { prop_a }; // Error on \";\" - unexpected token\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass B {\r\n\t[index: string]: string // Cannot put ; here\r\n\t[index: number]: { prop_a } // Because of this it treats [ like a beginning of array specification (string[]) and gives error: \"]\" expected\r\n}\r\n```",
