    "Description": "I bring [this question from StackOverflow][1] to here because I think there is no way to deal with some statements like:\r\n\r\n    #import \"file.js\"\r\n\r\nand possibly other statements in other dialects of javascript like [Apple's UIAutomation][2].\r\n\r\nI think a solution would be to add some compiler directives. That would tell TypeScript not to process a certain piece of code but just copy it into the result js file. \r\nI imagine something like GCC's pragmas (?)\r\n\r\n  [1]:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12916483/typescript-with-uiautomation-apples-library/12917670#12917670\r\n  [2]:http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/UIAutomationRef/_index.html",
