    "Description": "Functions like Date.setHours() return the miliseconds since 1970 when called.\r\nThe definitions in lib.d.ts on the other hand say they return a void.\r\nSince this is not conform spec, it would be good to see this addressed in a future release.\r\n\r\nEcma spec: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.5.34\r\n\r\nPS: This one was quite sneaky, but apparantly (void == void) returns true, so the following code compiled just fine :-)\r\n\r\nif (d.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0) == t.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0))\r\n",
