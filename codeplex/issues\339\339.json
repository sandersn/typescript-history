    "Description": "Dragging and dropping a .d.ts file into a .ts file from the solution explorer adds a reference in the form of /// reference path=\"ref1.d.ts\" />. Spend hours of searching but couldn't find anything until I noticed that its missing the starting <. So it should be /// <reference path=\"ref1.d.ts\" />. Can you reproduce this error?",

I attached that 'new' version as an attachment to this comment. So to be clear: this fix will be in the 1.5.3 or 1.6 version. But you can use the attached version in the meantime.",
