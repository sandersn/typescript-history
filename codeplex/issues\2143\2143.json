    "Description": "I find the language specification terribly cumbersome in use. \r\n\r\nA big factor is that it is one giant (slow) 150 pages PDF.. it is laggy, clunky and not navigable, it becomes a huge drag everytime I have to access it.\r\n\r\nCouldn't we get a simple HTML version? And broken up in chapters so we can easily scroll around.\r\n\r\nAssuming the source is more manageable then the PDF this should be easy to (re)generate.\r\n\r\n",

(wikipedia, github etc all have it).\n\nWith .pdf and .docx we all have to make sure we have the same version of the spec file and then send paragraph and page numbers.",
