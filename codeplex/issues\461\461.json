    "ClosedComment": "I'm guessing something called 'tsc.bat' somehow ended up on your PATH. If you run \"where tsc\", you should be able to find it. If \"where\" points to tsc.exe and you're still having to use 'call', please reactivate (with some details on your system information, if possible). Thanks!",

    "Description": "In 0.8.0, I was able to execute tsc syncronously from a batch file and do other stuff afterwards, e.g.:\r\n\r\ntsc \"src\\file.ts\" -out \"output\\file.js\"\r\ncopy \"stuff\" \"output\"\r\nNow, with 0.8.1, that no longer works. My stuff is no longer getting copied. A workaround is to use \"call\" when executing tsc, e.g.:\r\n\r\ncall tsc \"src\\file.ts\" -out \"output\\file.js\"\r\ncopy \"stuff\" \"output\"\r\nWhat changed and why?",
