    "Description": "it would be great if the TypeSript language service could look on disk for typescriptServices.js, so we can test changes from within VS.\r\n\r\nfor exampe, there's currently no way to enable to the '-cflowu' option for the language service. it's not configurable via the '<style/>' annotations and there doesn't seem to be a way to otherwise tweak the CompilerSettings that the language service uses. I'd like to make some tweaks to enable this, but it would require rebuilding the vsix, which I don't have the source for. if it looked on disk for the .js file, this wouldn't be a problem.",
