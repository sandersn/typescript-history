    "Description": "Could we have a using clause, known from C#, in TypeScript. The only alternative I see right now (as discussed on stackoverflow) is the use of an alias, which is less ideal than simply using the 'using' clause.\r\n\r\nThe pros of an alias are obvious. Make longer namespaces short. \r\nThe cons are that you're actullay introducing yet another indirection, plus that it still requires a prefix.\r\n\r\nThe using statement makes the consumption of a nicely modelled codebase much easier.\r\n\r\nIn case of namecollisions resulting from using the using clause, one can choose to specify the full namespace, or if desired use an alias.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
