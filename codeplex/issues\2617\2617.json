    "Description": "I've been using Typescript in LightSwitch for a while, and it's worked pretty well. That was, until I upgraded my client to the VS 2013 Update 3 RC. Now, Typescript tries to configure my project to used TypeScriptCompile and the typescript tools. Which normal would be fine, except this results in them being excluded from the solution explorer and breaks the project if you attempt to restart Visual Studio and reload the solution. Is there no way to turn off that option?",
