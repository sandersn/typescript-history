    "Description": "As per https://typescript.codeplex.com/discussions/543192 I have compiled the current repos version (using `jake local`), it is 1fd39d1244c01a856432666df8fc87ecb8ea9c48\r\n\r\nBecause I work in node with external module I appended  `export = TypeScript;` to the declaration file and `typescriptServices.js` to it get type checked.\r\n\r\nWorks for most code; WebStorm is very pleased with it. But now the compiler complains: \r\n\r\n````\r\nerror TS2040: Parameter 'options' of exported function has or is using private type 'FormattingOptions'.\r\n````\r\n\r\nAnd if I check the declaration file I see it is not in the `TypeScript` internal module but in the root so does not get exported with my modification.\r\n\r\nA quick check showed there are only two types outside the TypeScript module, maybe they should be moved?",
