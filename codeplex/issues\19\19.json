      "Message": "Thanks for the suggestion.   This is something we'll be considering for future updates.  It is generally inline with supporting more of the ECMAScript 6 capabilities - and in particular those that can be compiled to simple and clean ES3/ES5.\n\nIn areas where there is overlap with ECMAScript6 proposals, we are generally adopting (and recommending improvements if needed) the approach used in ES6.  In this case, the \"quasis\" (now called \"string templates\") feature aims to address these use cases: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:quasis\n\nSpecifically:\nvar myvar = \"bob\";\nvar s = `Hello ${myvar}`\n\nThis can also be used for multi-line strings:\nvar s2 = `Hi, \nhow are you?`\n\n\n",
