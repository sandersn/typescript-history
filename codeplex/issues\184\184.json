    "Description": "Right now, the only way to get TypeScript working on VS 2010 is to first install TypeScript via the .msi and then run the .vsix  manually on 2010. Can we get some official support for TypeScript in VS 2010 and perhaps an .msi that is specifically targeted at VS 2010? Would love to get TypeScript going in a project, but my team isn't getting VS 2012 until early next year.",
