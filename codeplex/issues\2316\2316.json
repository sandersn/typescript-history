    "Description": "If I have a TypeScript file with a line like this:\r\n\r\n    import MyIdea = require('../../MyIdea/myidea.d.ts');\r\n\r\nTypeScript will search for __myidea.d.ts.ts__ first (notice double .ts), and search for many other files all the way back to the root folder, but it won't actually search for the explicit d.ts file that was specified, so TypeScript will fail to import the module.\r\n\r\nThis may be correct according to the spec (section 11.1.), but the error messages are unhelpful: \"Unable to resolve external module \"../../MyIdea/myidea.d.ts\" \", and \"Module cannot be aliased to a non-module type.\".\r\n\r\nIt would be more useful if the unable to resolve external module was smart enough to notice the .d.ts on the end of the module name and suggest \"perhaps you meant \"../../MyIdea/myidea.d\"? \"  Or even better, if a .ts or .d.ts file is explicitly specified, perhaps try to require those files first before searching the directory structure.\r\n\r\nThis is really easy to see if you download Process Monitor from TechNet and filter for process name tsc.ext or devenv.exe as appropriate.\r\n",
