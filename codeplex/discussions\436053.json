Same cycle...\r<br />\nSo exactly what are you missing?\r<br />\n<br />\nGitHub properly have the most advantages when it comes to managing your project, where CodePlex has a limited number of advantages over GitHub, but all of them isn't in the core of hosting your source code, they are in how you write documentation or expose your project, deal with issues and so forth... Then again, maybe I am wrong here, my evaluation of GitHub vs. CodePlex is purely subjective, I prefer GitHub my self, so that might blind me.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso, think about it, if Microsoft want's codeplex to succeed as a place for OpenSource, moving all their own projects to the competitor seems like it would counter that... The fact that the Azure SDK's are hosted on GitHub is all speculations untill MS gives a reason, it could just as well be because that those projects started before CodePlex had support for Git.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnyways, point being, why bother with moving it?... Some will prefer the one, some the other... But both GitHub, CodePlex, BitBucket and so forth can be great places to host your OpenSource project, I think the rest comes down to personal preference.<br />\n",
