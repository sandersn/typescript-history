The way that I've always had to do it is to expand out the <code>this.g</code> reference to a full lambda, i.e.:<br />\n<br />\n<code>this.d(&quot;name&quot;, () =&gt; this.g());</code><br />\n<br />\nThat's definitely a more awkward syntax, and I wish the TS team would figure out a way to make <code>this</code> stickier (it's definitely a violation of the Rule of Least Astonishment that <em>sometimes</em> <code>this</code> points to the current class, but not always), but it works.<br />\n<br />\nKen<br />\n",
