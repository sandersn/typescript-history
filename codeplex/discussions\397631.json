Example:</p>\r\n<pre>var a = null;\n\nvar b = a ?? 5;\n\n//b is now 5</pre>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The &quot;?.&quot; is used for chains of property access. If any of the properties along the chain is null or undefined, undefined is returned. Example:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<pre>var a = {\n  b: {\n    c: 5\n  }\n};\na.b = null;\n\nvar d = a?.b?.c ;\n\n//d is now undefined rather than having thrown an exception.</pre>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I think it would be great for TypeScript to support both types of operators. They are just syntax sugar, but are still very useful and make very common boilerplate code much more concise. They also complement the ternary operator really nicely.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n(By the way, when is C# going to get the &quot;.?&quot; operator already???)</p>\r\n",
