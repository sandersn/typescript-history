    "Description": "When it compiles my code, TypeScript includes an __extends declaration at the top of every file:\r\n````\r\nvar __extends = this.__extends || function (d, b) {\r\n    /* istanbul ignore next */\r\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\r\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\r\n    __.prototype = b.prototype;\r\n    d.prototype = new __();\r\n};\r\n````\r\nThis works fine behind-the-scenes, but it creates an inconsistency when it comes to using something like karma-coverage to generate reports. This declaration contains two function calls and a branch in the code (the || usage), which only ever get exercised on the first declaration, leaving dozens (if not hundreds) of subsequent declarations for which there is no coverage. This makes a file with otherwise 100% code coverage look sorely uncovered in the coverage reports.\r\n\r\nI propose that the TSC compiler be given an option to _not_ include this declaration in more than one file, or just exclude it altogether.\r\n\r\n",
