    "Description": "The `tsc -d filename.ts` is great:\r\n* It lets me create a declaration file that I can use for quicker complication of other modules (I can use reference comments to refer to it). \r\n* I can comment it and share it with colleagues as a quick reference for what a complex class or module does, while not forcing them to read the implementation.\r\n\r\nBut! After I do it, if I change anything, I have not way to check that the declaration file still matches my implementation. \r\n\r\nHow about a new comment tag that allows me to check a declaration is still matched by an implementation? \r\n```\r\n/// <declaration path='path-to-declaration-file1.d.ts' />\r\n```\r\nand \r\n```\r\n/// <implementation path='path-to-implementation-file1.ts' />\r\n/// <implementation path='path-to-implementation-file2.ts' />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?
