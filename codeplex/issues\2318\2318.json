    "ClosedComment": "This is very much intentional.\n\nFor example, consider Array#forEach. Its callback provides you three parameters, but the great majority of code using it only uses (and declares) the first parameter. It would be burdensome and pointless to force you to declare more parameters than you need.\n\nThis is also important for functions that take some variable number of arguments and operate directly on the arguments array.\n\nNote that it's basically impossible to come up with a plausible scenario where you would accidently write too few parameters in a function implementation.",

    "Description": "Hello all:\r\n\r\nIf you are using TS carefully, just like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface IMultiple\r\n{\r\n    (a: string): string;\r\n    (b: string,c:string): string;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar Fun: IMultiple = (a:string) =>\r\n{\r\n    return a;\r\n};\r\n```\r\nAnd the \"Fun\" can accept one or two parameters according to the intellisense, however the generated js code isï¼š\r\n```\r\nvar Fun = function (a) {\r\n    return a;\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThis seems that the \"c\" is duplicatedly-defined.\r\nOf course __I know that js doesn't check the number of parameters passed to the function. However since your TS is a strongly-typed language, you should check this by its parameter type, number as well as order sequencials. So I think in TS that's a INALID calling, and you microsoft SHOULD FORBID this synax from appearing.__",
