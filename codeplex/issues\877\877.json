    "Description": "Currently typescript uses the __\"Script Identifier\"__ color for both vars and types. When you rollover a var, typescript clearly knows its a \"var\" definition. When you rollover a type, typescript knows its a \"class\" definition. Vars and classes should use different colors.\r\n\r\nThere should be 2 settings in VS, __\"Script Type\"__ and __\"Script Identifier\"__ for these, and syntax highlighting should use these colors when coloring the page.\r\n\r\nIf a 3rd setting could be added for functions : __\"Script Function\"__, and used for function definitions and function calls it would be really amazing.\r\n\r\n![Image](http://i49.tinypic.com/2ln90fd.jpg)\r\n\r\nAs you can see \"number\" is the \"Keyword\" color, which is fine, but BigInt is defined as a \"interface BigInt\" and should be another color.",
