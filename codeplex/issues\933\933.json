    "Description": "Basically it would be nice to have the same functionality as with .NET partial classes. The most important use case would be when generating classes from existing code or other sources to allow for extensibility of these generated classes.\r\n\r\nexample implementation\r\n```\r\n//generated entity\r\npartial class Person{\r\n   Id: number;\r\n   Name: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand then have the option to extend functionality\r\n```\r\npartial class Person{\r\n   isDirty: bool;\r\n   \r\n   Save(){\r\n      if(isDirty == true){\r\n          //do something with the data....\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOh and of course great work so far! I Love typescript.",
