The third tree is wrong, as the \"data\" does not contain the mandatory \"args\".\r\n\r\nIf you remove one of the empty trees (elements 0 or 1 in the array), an error will be given.",

With fixed you probably mean fixed in the next version.\n\nWouldn't it be a good idea if there were a playground which uses the current development build? If a user finds a problem with the release version, he could test there and avoid the work for creating a minimal test case.",
