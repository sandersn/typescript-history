    "Description": "Big things are brewing and Mozilla is showing some pretty impressive stuff with asm.js work.  It would be great to see a compiler option to build TypeScript to asm.js. I realize this spec is still evolving, but I hope that the TypeScript team is keeping an eye on this and thinking about it as an option for the future.",
