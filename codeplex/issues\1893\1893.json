    "Description": "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI'm just looking at improving the jquery validation DefinitelyTyped typings.  As I was addressing the ```success``` validation option I came upon an issue. (For details on this option see the _success_ entry about 3/4s of the way down the page on http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/ .)  Namely, within an interface it doesn't seem to be possible to model alternate overloads.\r\n\r\nThe ```success``` validation option that is passed to the ```validate``` method in jQuery Validation can either be a ```string``` *__or__* a ```Function```.  So I wanted to change this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface ValidationOptions\r\n{\r\n\t// ....\r\n\tsuccess?: any;\r\n\t// ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface ValidationOptions\r\n{\r\n\t// ....\r\n\tsuccess?: string;\r\n\tsuccess?: (label: JQuery, element: HTMLElement) => void;\r\n\t// ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've had a dig around on StackOverflow / historic issues and whilst I've found similar issues I haven't spotted this specific issue so I thought I'd raise it here.  Is this not possible with TS at present?  \r\n\r\nIf not - are there any plans to introduce this?  ",
