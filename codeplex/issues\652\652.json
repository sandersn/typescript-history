    "Description": "It is possible to compile the following function code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate foo(value: number): bool {\r\n       if (value == 0) {\r\n          return true;\r\n       }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nShouldn't this result in a compilation error saying something like: \"not all code paths return a value\"?\r\n\r\nIf the above should be allowed (ex. assuming return value is undefined, which converts to false) then it should be possible not to return anything in a function like:\r\n```\r\nprivate foo(value: number): bool { }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was unable to find any information for the above in the Language Specification document. My guess is when I give return type other then void a value should always be explicitly returned.\r\n",
