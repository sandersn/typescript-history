    "ClosedComment": "Rename in Visual Studio should definitely work in the general case. If there's something bad going on due to the Git integration as you suspect we'd love to track it down though. Can you elaborate and re-open this if you're able to get us a clearer way to reproduce the issue? It's not clear to me what you mean about switching branches having an effect.",

    "Description": "If I rename a TypeScript file in Visual Studio 2013, I get the \"blue wait circle\" and the application greys out. This keeps happening until I restart Visual Studio, and it happened many times, for several different files.\r\n\r\nUpdate. This could have something to do with Git and switching branches. I am not seeing the problem today.",
